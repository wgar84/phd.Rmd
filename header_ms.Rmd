We used a set of theoretical covariance matrices to investigate Type I and II error rates for either MHI and RV metrics; the construction of such matrices is detailed in the Supplemental Information.
Here, it suffices to say that we build two different sets of covariance matrices: one with known modular patterns embedded, referred to as $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices, and another that represents random covariance structure, denominated $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices.
For each of the six sets of empirical matrices we use here, we built a set of $10000$ covariance matrices of each case (either $\mathbf{C}_s$ or $\mathbf{C}_r$) that mimic the statistical properties of each set, obtaining from these matrices samples of increasing sample size (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 individuals).
