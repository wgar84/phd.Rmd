\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

The study of modularity in morphological systems has increased in the
past twenty years, parallel to the popularization of geometric
morphometrics, which has led to the emergence of different criteria for
detecting modularity on landmark data. However, compared to usual
covariance matrix estimators, Procrustes estimators have properties that
hinder their use. Here, we compare different representations of form,
focusing on detecting modularity patterns defined \emph{a priori}; we
also compare two metrics: one derived from traditional morphometrics
(MHI) and another that emerged in the context of landmark data (RV).
Using Anthropoid skulls, we compare these metrics over three
representations of form: interlandmark distances, Procrustes residuals,
and local shape variables. Over Procrustes residuals, both tests fail to
detect modularity patterns, while in remaining representations they show
the distinction between early and late development in skull ontogeny. To
estimate type I and II error rates, we built covariance matrices of
known structure; these tests indicate that, considering both effect and
sample sizes, tests using MHI are more robust than those using RV.
However, both metrics have low power when used on Procrustes residuals.
Thus, we conclude that the influence of development and function is
poorly represented on Procrustes estimators for covariance matrices.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Modularity is a characteristic property that biological systems exhibit
regarding the distribution of interactions between their composing
elements; that is, in a given system, subsets of elements, denominated
modules, interact more among themselves than with other such subsets
(Newman 2006; Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2007; Wagner et al. 2007). This
property has been well documented at different levels of biological
organization, from the dynamics of metabolic networks (e.g. Ravasz et
al. 2002; Andrade et al. 2011) to the structure of interactions among
individuals in populations (e.g. Fortuna et al. 2008) and among species
in ecological communities (e.g. Genini et al. 2010).

Regarding morphological systems, the concept of modularity is associated
with the framework of morphological integration (Olson and Miller 1958;
Cheverud 1996), which refers to the organization of covariances or
correlations between morphological elements and the hypotheses
concerning their relationships. In this context, modularity refers to
the uneven distribution of genetic effects over phenotypic variation
articulated through development (genotype/phenotype map; Wagner 1996);
in a classical quantitative genetics view, these genetic effects are the
result of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium (Falconer and Mackay
1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998). A genotype/phenotype map composed of
clusters of genes that affect clusters of traits (with little overlap)
exhibits a modular organization; this structure is thought to emerge as
the result of selection for distinct demands (Wagner and Altenberg 1996;
Espinosa-Soto and Wagner 2010; Rueffler et al. 2012; Melo and Marroig
2015). For instance, the decoupling between fore- and hindlimb function
in certain mammalian lineages such as bats (Young and Hallgrímsson 2005)
and apes (Young et al. 2010) is associated with the modularization of
both structures, as shown by reduced phenotypic correlations between
fore- and hindlimbs and increased correlations between elements within
these limbs.

The recognition of variational modules (Wagner and Altenberg 1996;
Wagner et al. 2007) using covariance or correlation patterns in adult
populations involves an uderstanding of the underlying developmental and
functional dynamics among morphological traits (Polly 2008; Zelditch and
Swiderski 2011). Skull development in mammals is composed of a series of
steps, such as neurocranial growth induced by brain development, and
growth mediated by muscle-bone interactions, with spatiotemporal
overlapping between such steps (Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008; Herring
2011; Cardini and Polly 2013). Both timing and scope of each step is
regulated by different profiles of genetic expression exhibited by cells
originated from different embryonic precursors and their response to
signaling factors expressed at the regional level; the response to these
signaling factors further changes cell expression profiles, thus
generating a feedback loop of diferentiation (Turing 1952; Marcucio et
al. 2005; Meinhardt 2008; Hallgrímsson et al. 2009; Franz-Odendaal 2011;
Minelli 2011). Each step in this temporal hierarchy may be regarded as
modular, since they affect a coherent subset of tissues more so than
others (Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008), although each step affect
adjoining regions through interactions among developing tissues
(Cheverud et al. 1992; Lieberman 2011; Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman
2014); thus, the overlapping of such processes throughout development
may complicate their association with correlation patterns (Hallgrímsson
et al. 2009).

Furthermore, variation in growth rates, which emerges into size
variation (Porto et al. 2013; Pélabon et al. 2013), has a particular
importance in the context of mammalian morphological systems. Here size
variation refers to variation in both scale (isometric variation) and
scale relationships (allometric variation). This source of variation
affects the overall level of correlations between morphological traits
(Wagner 1984; Young and Hallgrímsson 2005), and the magnitude of
integration has important consequences for both the evolution of mean
phenotypes (Schluter 1996; Marroig and Cheverud 2005, 2010; Cardini and
Polly 2013) and the evolution of morphological integration itself
(Oliveira et al. 2009; Porto et al. 2009, 2013; Shirai and Marroig
2010).

In this context, adaptive landscapes may be the central component
governing both the stability and divergence in integration patterns, as
both stabilizing (Jones 2007; Arnold et al. 2008) and directional (Jones
et al. 2012; Melo and Marroig 2015) selection have been shown to produce
changes in integration patterns. The empirical evidence available
demonstrates that both stability (e.g. Marroig and Cheverud 2001;
Oliveira et al. 2009; Porto et al. 2009; Willmore et al. 2009) and
divergence (e.g. Monteiro and Nogueira 2010; Grabowski et al. 2011;
Sanger et al. 2012; Haber 2015) of integration patterns are possible
outcomes of the evolutionary process. Therefore, the question of whether
any of these two scenarios is the rule or exception at macroevolutionary
scales remains open, although some theoretical and methodological
differences between these works with respect to the representation of
morphological features need to be taken into consideration.

\subsubsection{Morphometrics}\label{morphometrics}

Traditionally, morphological features are measured using distances among
elements defined in general terms, such as ``cranial length'' or
``cranial width''. Pearson and Davin (1924) introduced the notion that
measurements should be restricted to single osteological elements,
preferably as distances between homologous features that could be
identified in a wide taxonomic coverage. Cheverud (1982) accomodates
this notion into the framework of morphological integration, thus
considering individual measurements over single bones as local
representations of regional phenomena, that is, the functional,
developmental and genetic interactions that produce covariances among
these elements. The influence of such interactions over covariance or
correlation matrices can be accessed by defining a subset of
measurements which fall under the scope of a particular process and
estimating a metric that summarizes such partitioning; the null
hypothesis that this partition is undistinguishable from
randomly-defined partitions can then be tested using Monte Carlo methods
(Mantel 1967; Cheverud et al. 1989).

In the past three decades, geometric morphometrics (Bookstein 1982,
1991; Kendall 1984; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Goodall 1991) have been
consolidated as a quantitative framework for the representation of
biological shape as geometric configurations of homologous features
(landmarks; Bookstein 1991). Two principles are central here: first, the
conceptual and statistical separation of size and shape as components of
biological form; second, the use of superimposition-based methods (GPA:
Generalized Procrustes Analysis; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Goodall 1991) for
the estimation of shape statistical parameters, such as mean shape and
shape covariance structure. Procrustes estimators were proposed as a
solution to the problem that landmark configurations are arbitrarily
rotated and translated; such nuisance parameters are impossible to
estimate without any assumptions (Goodall 1991; Lele and McCulloch
2002), a situation known as the identifiability problem (Neyman and
Scott 1948).

Although the use of Procrustes estimators is currently widespread in
geometric morphometrics toolboxes (e.g. Klingenberg 2011; Adams and
Otárola-Castillo 2013), it has not been without criticisms, either with
respect to the estimation of mean shape configurations (e.g. Lele 1993;
Kent and Mardia 1997; Huckemann 2012) and of shape covariance matrices
(Walker 2000; Adams et al. 2004; Linde and Houle 2009; Márquez et al.
2012). For configurations in two-dimensional space, Procrustes
estimators for mean shape perform well under isotropic landmark
covariance structure (Kent and Mardia 1997), a situation of null
covariances among landmarks and coordinates; however, when this
assumption does not hold, Procrustes estimates for mean shape behave
badly, especially when shape variation is high (Huckemann 2011). The
example provided by Linde and Houle (2009) demonstrates that when such
assumption is broken shape covariance patterns are also poorly
estimated; if the unknown landmark covariance matrix is structured due
to regional differences in covariance-generating processes, such
variation will be displaced and effectively spread out through the
entire landmark configuration.

A number of alternatives for estimating shape covariance matrices have
already emerged; some of these alternatives (e.g. Monteiro et al. 2005;
Theobald and Wuttke 2006; Zelditch et al. 2009; Linde and Houle 2009)
propose modifications to the Procrustes analysis in order to deal with
heterogeneity in landmark covariance structure. Márquez et al. (2012)
propose another definition of shape descriptors using
interpolation-based techniques (Cheverud and Richtsmeier 1986; Bookstein
1989) as a starting point; such descriptors refer to infinitesimal
expansions or retractions in reference to a unknown mean shape (Woods
2003) estimated at definite locations amidst sampled landmarks. The
authors argue that these descriptors are proper local measurements of
shape variation, as they can directly be linked to biological processes
that generate covariation among morphological elements.

Despite these caveats regarding Procrustes estimators for covariance
matrices, the use of such estimators for investigating aspects of
morphological integration has increased in the past ten years (e.g.
Klingenberg et al. 2004; Goswami and Polly 2010; Drake and Klingenberg
2010; Martínez-Abadías et al. 2011; Sanger et al. 2012). The results
found by these authors are sometimes in stark constrast with similar
works using interlandmark distances (e.g. Cheverud et al. 1997; Oliveira
et al. 2009; Porto et al. 2009). For instance, Martínez-Abadías et al.
(2011) found a pattern of strong integration among partitions in human
skull covariance patterns, while Oliveira et al. (2009) and Porto et al.
(2009) demonstrated that humans are among the most modular examples of
mammalian skull covariance patterns. Likewise, while Cheverud et al.
(1997) had shown that 70\% of the pleiotropic effects are confined to
either anterior or posterior mandibular components, Klingenberg et al.
(2004) has found no evidence for a modular distribution of pleiotropic
effects among the partitions of the mouse mandible using the same strain
of intercrossed mice at the same generation. Furthermore, aside from the
issues regarding Procrustes estimators, these works also propose
different methods to quantify the effects of interactions over
covariance patterns. For example, Martínez-Abadías et al. (2011) and
Sanger et al. (2012) use the RV coefficient, a multivariate correlation
coefficient defined by Escoufier (1973) which has been used to quantify
modular relationships over landmark covariance patterns since
Klingenberg (2009) has proposed its use in this context.

\subsubsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}

In the present work, we compare the methods described by Cheverud et al.
(1989) and Klingenberg (2009) to test \emph{a priori} defined modularity
patterns using anthropoid primates as a model organism. In order to
compare the performance of these methods with respect to different
representations of form, individuals in our sample are represented both
as interlandmark distances and shape variables. Furthermore, we used an
approach based on the construction of theoretical covariance matrices;
such matrices are used in order to estimate Type I and Type II error
rates for both methods. Since these methods were designed under
different frameworks, the present work puts some effort into unifying
both methods into the same conceptual and statistical framework, in
order to produce meaningful comparisons.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Sample}\label{sample}

The database we used here (\autoref{tab:modcomp_otu}) consists of 21
species, distributed across all taxonomic ranks within Anthropoidea
above the genus level. We selected these species from a broader database
(Marroig and Cheverud 2001; Oliveira et al. 2009) in order to reduce the
effects of low sample sizes over estimates of modularity patterns.
Individuals in our sample are represented by 36 registered landmarks,
measured using a Polhemus 3Draw (for Platyrrhini) and a Microscribe 3DS
(for Catarrhini). Twenty-two unique landmarks represent each individual
(\autoref{fig:landmarks}, \autoref{tab:lms}), since 14 of the 36
registered landmarks are bilaterally symmetrical. For more details on
landmark registration, see Marroig and Cheverud (2001) and Oliveira et
al. (2009).

\input{Tables/modcomp_otu}

For each OTU, we estimated phenotypic covariance and correlation
matrices for three different types of variables: tangent space
residuals, estimated from a Procrustes superimposition for the entire
sample, using the set of landmarks described on both \autoref{tab:lms}
and \autoref{fig:landmarks} (henceforth Procrustes residuals);
interlandmark distances, described in \autoref{tab:dist}; and local
shape variables (Márquez et al. 2012), which are measurements of
infinitesimal log volume transformations between each sample unit and a
reference (mean) shape, based upon an interpolation function that
describes shape variation between sampled landmarks. In this context, we
used thin plate splines as interpolating functions (Bookstein 1989). We
obtained 38 transformations corresponding to the locations of the
mipoints between pairs of landmarks used to define interlandmark
distances, in order to produce a dataset that represents shape (i.e.,
form without isometric variation; Bookstein 1991; Zelditch et al. 2004)
while retaining the overall properties of the interlandmark distance
dataset, such as dimensionality for example. Furthermore, we were able
to use the same hypotheses of trait associations for both types of
variables since the position of local shape variables through the skull
mirrors the position of interlandmark distances, although they are
conceptually different types of measurements.

Here we considered only covariance or correlation structure for the
symmetrical component of variation; therefore, prior to any analysis, we
controlled the effects of variation in assymmetry. For interlandmark
distances, we averaged bilateral measurements within each individual.
For both Procrustes residuals and local shape variables, we followed the
procedure outlined in Klingenberg et al. (2002) for bilateral structures
by obtaning for each individual a symmetrical landmark configuration,
averaging each actual shape with its reflection along the sagittal
plane; we estimate local shape variables afterwards. With respect to
Procrustes residuals, landmarks placed along the sagittal plane will
have zero variation in the direction normal to this plane; we aligned
all specimens' sagittal plane to the $xz$ plane, thus removing the $y$
component for each of these landmarks from covariance/correlation
matrices.

For each dataset, we estimated covariance and correlation matrices after
removing fixed effects of little interest in the present context, such
as sexual dimorphism, for example. For interlandmark distances and local
shape variables these effects were removed through a multivariate linear
model adjusted for each species, according to \autoref{tab:modcomp_otu};
for Procrustes residuals, the same effects were removed by centering all
group means to each species' mean shape since the loss of degrees of
freedom imposed by the GPA prohibits the use of a full multivariate
linear model over this kind of data to remove fixed effects.

In order to consider the effects of size variation on modularity
patterns we used different procedures to remove the influence of size
from each type of variable. For interlandmark distances we used the
approach established by Bookstein et al. (1985); if $\mathbf{C}$ is a
correlation matrix, we obtained a correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$
without the effect of size using the equation

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{C} - \lambda_1 v_1 v^{t}_1
\label{eq:iso}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_1$ and $v_1$ refer respectively to the first eigenvalue
and eigenvector of the spectral decomposition of $\mathbf{C}$, since
this eigenvector commonly represents size variation in mammals,
especially when interlandmark distances are considered (Wagner 1984;
Mitteroecker et al. 2004; Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2007); $t$ denotes
matrix transpose.

For Procrustes residuals and local shape variables the effects of
isometric variation were removed by normalizing each individual to unit
centroid size. However, allometric relationships still influence
covariance or correlation structure. In order to remove this effect we
used a procedure based upon Mitteroecker et al. (2004), which relies on
the estimation of an allometric component $a$ for each OTU, composed of
normalized regression coefficents for each of the $m$ shape variables
(either Procrustes residuals or local shape variables) over log Centroid
Size. If $\mathbf{S}$ is a covariance matrix, we obtained a covariance
matrix $\mathbf{R}$ without the influence of allometric relationships
using the equation

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = (I_m - aa^t) \mathbf{S} (I_m - aa^t)
\label{eq:allo}
\end{equation}

where $I_m$ represents the identity matrix of size $m$. Therefore, our
empirical dataset consists of six sets of covariance/correlation
matrices, corresponding to each type of morphometric variables
considering the presence or absence of size variation.

\subsection{Empirical Tests}\label{empirical-tests}

Using these six sets of covariance/correlation matrices, we tested the
hypotheses of trait associations described in \autoref{tab:lms} for
Procrustes residuals and \autoref{tab:dist} for interlandmark distances
and local shape variables. These trait sets are grouped with respect to
their scope; two regional sets (Face and Neurocranium), each divided
into three localized trait sets (Oral, Nasal and Zygomatic for the Face;
Orbit, Base and Vault for the Neurocranium).

For all hypotheses, we estimated Modularity Hypothesis Indexes (MHI;
Porto et al. 2013) and the RV coefficient (Klingenberg 2009). Both
statistics are estimated by partitioning covariance or correlation
matrices into blocks; if $\mathbf{A}$ is a covariance or correlation
matrix, the partition \[
\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{A}_h & \mathbf{A}_b \\
\mathbf{A}^t_b & \mathbf{A}_c
\end{bmatrix}
\] indicates that the block $\mathbf{A}_h$ contains covariances or
correlations between traits that belong to the trait set being
considered, while $\mathbf{A}_c$ represents the complementary trait set;
$\mathbf{A}_b$ represents the block of covariances or correlations
between the two sets. Thus, covariance ($\mathbf{S}$) or correlation
($\mathbf{C}$) matrices can be partitioned into a similar scheme. We
estimated MHI values using the equation

\begin{equation}
MHI = \frac {\bar{\rho}_{+} - \bar{\rho}_{-}} {ICV}
\label{eq:mi}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{\rho}_{+}$ represents the mean correlation in
$\mathbf{C}_h$, $\bar{\rho}_{-}$ represents the mean correlation in the
remaining sets (both $\mathbf{C}_b$ and $\mathbf{C}_c$), and $ICV$ is
the coefficient of variation of eigenvalues of the associated covariance
matrix, which is a measurement of the overall integration between all
traits (Shirai and Marroig 2010). We estimated RV coefficients for each
hypothesis using the relationship

\begin{equation}
RV = \frac{tr(\mathbf{S}_{b}\mathbf{S}^t_{b})}{\sqrt{tr(\mathbf{S}_h \mathbf{S}_h)tr(\mathbf{S}_c \mathbf{S}_c)}}
\label{eq:rv}
\end{equation}

where $tr$ represents the sum of diagonal elements in any given matrix
($tr \mathbf{A} = \sum_i a_{ii}$).

The partitioning scheme outlined above assumes that the complementary
trait set does not represent an actual hypothesis; however, we may
choose to consider that both sets ($\mathbf{A}_h$ and $\mathbf{A}_c$)
represent two distinct hypothesis. The estimation of RV coefficients
remains the same; however, MHI values are estimated considering that
$\bar{\rho}_{+}$ is the average correlation in both $\mathbf{C}_h$ and
$\mathbf{C}_c$, while $\bar{\rho}_{-}$ represents the average
correlation only in $\mathbf{C}_b$. In the case of the distinction
between Facial and Neurocranial traits, we estimated MHI values in this
manner, reporting values for this estimate under the denomination
`Neuroface', following Marroig and Cheverud (2001), along independent
MHI estimates for each region. Furthermore, since both Face and
Neurocranium are two disjoint trait sets when any morphometric variable
type is considered, RV coefficient values for either set are equal;
therefore, a single RV value is reported for both regions, for each
variable type.

In order to test the hypothesis that a trait set represents a
variational module, we used a randomization procedure generating 1000
random trait sets with the same number of traits as the original set,
calculating MHI and RV values for each iteration. For each trait set and
covariance/correlation matrix, we used these values to construct
distributions for both statistics representing the null hypothesis that
a given trait set is a random arrangement without meaningful
relationships; we then compare this null distribution to the real value
obtained. For MHIs we consider this null hypothesis rejected when the
real value is higher than the upper bound for the distribution,
considering the significance level established; for RV coefficients, the
null hypothesis is rejected when the real RV value is lower than the
lower bound for the distribution, also considering significance level.
For Procrustes residuals the randomization procedure maintains
coordinates within the same landmark together in each randomly generated
trait set, following Klingenberg and Leamy (2001).

While the procedure for estimating significance for MHIs is derived from
Mantel's (1967) approach (as outlined by Cheverud et al. 1989), we chose
to generate null distributions for MHI directly, instead of estimating
matrix correlation values for both real and randomized matrices.
Estimated $p$-values in both cases remain the same, and the additional
step of calculating matrix correlations would produce an unnecessary
difference between the estimation of signficance for MHI and RV.

\subsection{Estimation of Error Rates}\label{estimation-of-error-rates}

We used a set of theoretical covariance matrices to investigate Type I
and II error rates for either MHI and RV metrics; the construction of
such matrices is detailed in the Supplemental Information. Here, it
suffices to say that we build two different sets of covariance matrices:
one with known modular patterns embedded, referred to as $\mathbf{C}_s$
matrices, and another that represents random covariance structure,
denominated $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices. For each of the six sets of
empirical matrices we use here, we built a set of $10000$ covariance
matrices of each case (either $\mathbf{C}_s$ or $\mathbf{C}_r$) that
mimic the statistical properties of each set, obtaining from these
matrices samples of increasing sample size (20, 40, 60, 80, 100
individuals).

If samples were generated from a $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrix, this represents
a situation of a true null hypothesis for either tests, since the
correlation matrix used to produce the sample was generated by a
permutation of the hypothesis being tested. Therefore, testing
hypotheses over $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices allows us to estimate Type I
error rates, or the proportion of cases in which a true null hypothesis
is rejected, given a significance level. In an adequate test, we expect
that both quantities, significance level and Type I error rate, will be
identical.

The opposite case, when we sampled $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices, represents a
situation in which we know that the null hypothesis of either test is
false, since we are testing the hypothesis that the partitioning scheme
used to generate that particular matrix actually represents two
variational modules. Thus, we estimated Type II error rates, or the
probability that a false null hypothesis is not rejected, given a
significance level; here, we represent Type II error using the power for
each test, by simply calculating the complementar probability to Type II
error rate. In an adequate test, we expect that power will rapidly reach
a plateau when significance level is still close to zero, and further
increasing $P(\alpha)$ will not produce a great increase in power.

Our estimates of power for both statistics should also be controlled for
effect size, since sampled correlations may generate a correlation
structure that is not detected due to small differences among within-set
and between-set correlations. For each correlation matrix sampled, we
estimate squared between-set correlations ($b^2$), in order to use it as
an estimate of effect size that is not directly associated with either
MHI and RV metrics. We expect that power for either tests decreases with
increasing $b^2$ values, as effect size would also decrease.

Previous tests we made indicated no differences between our estimation
of empirical RV coefficients, based upon our own code, and estimates
provided by MorphoJ (Klingenberg 2011). In order to obtain symmetrical
landmarks configurations, we used code provided by Annat Haber,

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Empirical Tests}\label{empirical-tests-1}

Tests performed using MHI for localized trait sets (Oral, Nasal,
Zygomatic, Orbit, Base, and Vault; \autoref{fig:Func}a) detect a
consistent pattern among OTUs for interlandmark distances and local
shape variables; in the first set the Oral subregion is detected as a
modular partition, and, when size is removed, the Vault subregion is
also detected; both Orbit and Base region are not detected in any of
these tests. With local shape variables, Oral, Vault Nasal, and
Zygomatic sets were detected consistently across OTUs; the removal of
allometric variation affects only the detection of the Vault in some
groups. Furthermore, the Base sub-region is detected only in 3 of 42
tests performed over local shape variables, pooling together size and
size-free correlation patterns.

For Procrustes residuals, the pattern of detection among sub-regions and
OTUs is more inconsistent; for instance, the Base sub-region is detected
in several OTUs, which contrasts this type of morphometric variable with
the other two types. Observing the actual MHI values,
\autoref{fig:Func}a also indicates that Procrustes residuals display a
low variance of this metric within each OTU, while interlandmark
distances and local shape variables display a consistent pattern of
variation, with lower values for the Base and, for interlandmark
distances, Orbit trait sets, while the Oral, Nasal and Vault regions
display higher values consistently.

values are associated with higher MHI values and lower RV values, as the
alternate hypothesis for each statistic is formulated in a corresponding
manner; see text for details. \label{fig:Func}}
\end{figure}

Tests performed using RV coefficients (\autoref{fig:Func}b) show a more
irregular pattern for each variable type. When interlandmark distances
are considered, most tests detect the Vault sub-region with size
variation retained, and the Base sub-region when size variation is
removed. For Procrustes residuals, few tests are able to reject their
null hypotheses, detecting only a handful of valid modular partitions.
Tests performed on local shape variables display the opposite behavior:
almost all partitions are detected, regardless of whether allometric
variation has been retained or removed. Moreover, RV values display a
pattern of marked variation among OTUs, more so than between values
within each OTU; notably, \emph{Macaca fascicularis} and \emph{Papio
anubis} show RV values much higher than those estimated on remaining
species. Such pattern can be observed both on interlandmark distances
with size retained and in Procrustes residuals.

With respect to regional trait sets (Face and Neurocranium), tests
performed using MHI (\autoref{fig:Dev}a) indicate a pattern consistent
with the findings regarding localized sets (\autoref{fig:Func}a).
Considering interlandmark distances, Facial traits are detected as a
valid modular partition both with size variation retained or removed,
while Neurocranial traits are detected as a valid partition only when
size variation is removed. This pattern mirrors the contrast between
Oral and Vault traits in the localized sets regarding interlandmark
distances. For Procrustes residuals, Neurocranial traits are a valid
partition with both size retained and removed; once again, this pattern
mirrors the detection of the Basicranial partition as valid in the
localized sets. Finally, in local shape variables, both Face and
Neurocranium are detected as valid with size retained; with size
removed, only the Face is recognized consistently. The same can be
observed for localized sets, where removing allometric variation affects
the detection of the Vault set in some OTUs. The tests for the
distinction of within-set and between-set correlations for these two
sets (designated `Neuroface') show a pattern that is consistent with
tests for the individual sets: if one of the sets was previously
detected, this distinction is also detected as valid.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

associated with higher MHI values and lower RV values, as the alternate
hypothesis for each statistic is formulated in a corresponding manner;
see text for details. \label{fig:Dev}}
\end{figure}

Testing the distinction between Face and Neurocranium using RV
coefficients (\autoref{fig:Dev}b) show that in most cases both regions
are considered distinct and valid variational modules for interlandmark
distances and local shape variables; for Procrustes residuals, only a
handful of taxa show the same result. In this case the correspondence
with localized trait sets (\autoref{fig:Func}b) is more difficult due to
the lack of independent tests for each region.

\subsection{Error Rates}\label{error-rates}

Comparing the distributions of MHI and RV values from theoretical
matrices with respect to their structure (\autoref{fig:stat_dist_sim})
shows marked differences between metrics and morphometric variables from
which correlations are sampled. In general, the distribution of MHI
values obtained from $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices is the same, while the
distributions for $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices for this metric are more
disjoint from the former distribution in local shape variables than in
Procrustes residuals, with interlandmark distances representing an
intermediate case, regardless of whether size was retained or removed.
For RV values, all distributions overlap to some degree; for local shape
variables and interlandmark distances with size retained, either
distributions ($\mathbf{C}_r$ and $\mathbf{C}_s$) overlap to a lesser
extent.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/stat_dist_sim-1.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of Modularity Hypothesis Index and RV Coefficient
for theoretical correlation matrices. \label{fig:stat_dist_sim}}
\end{figure}

Regarding the relationship between significance levels and Type I error
rates estimated over $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices, \autoref{fig:type1} shows
that these quantities approach an identity relationship very closely
regardless of whether we use MHI or RV to quantify variational
modularity; even at low sample sizes Type I error rates are very close
to significance levels. Furthermore, the effect of sampling correlations
from size-free distributions does not change Type I error rates.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/type1-1.pdf}
\caption{Type I error rates as a function of the chosen significance
level regarding tests for variational modularity applied on
$\mathbf{C}_r$ correlation matrices. The solid black line represents the
identity relationship. \label{fig:type1}}
\end{figure}

The relationship between power and significance levels (estimated over
$\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices) shows substantial differences with respect to
the chosen metric (MHI or RV) and to the type of variable that provides
sampled correlations. Considering local shape variables
(\autoref{fig:type2_def}), tests using either MHI and RV have high
power, even at low sample or effect sizes; increasing these quantities
further increases power. However, for lower effect sizes (represented by
high average squared correlation between sets, $b^2$) power for tests
using MHI is higher than for those using RV; as effect size increases
(lower $b^2$ values), the difference in power between the two statistics
decreases. For local shape variables, sampling from its associated
size-free correlation distribution implies minor differences in power
for both statistics.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/type2_def-1.pdf}
\caption{Power for both MHI and RV statistics as a function of the
chosen significance levels with respect to tests for variational
modularity applied on $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices with values sampled from
the distribution of correlations between local shape variables. Lines
are colored with respect to quantiles of the $b^2$ distribution,
according to the legend. \label{fig:type2_def}}
\end{figure}

For interlandmark distances (\autoref{fig:type2_ed}) there are
substantial differences on the relationship between power and
significance level if we consider the different parameters. First, the
effect of sampling from the size-free correlation distribution in order
to build $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices produces a substantial decrease in
power for either tests; however, this decrease is more pronounced for
tests based on the RV statistic, since for lower effect sizes (high
$b^2$ values) power approaches an identity relationship with
significance level. Sample size also interferes with this relationship
since increasing this quantity also increases power when higher effect
sizes (low $b^2$ values) are considered.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/type2_ed-1.pdf}
\caption{Power for both MHI and RV statistics as a function of the
chosen significance levels with respect to tests for variational
modularity applied on $\mathbf{C}_s$ correlation matrices with values

distances. Lines are colored with respect to quantiles of the $b^2$
distribution, according to the legend. The solid black line represents
the identity relationship. \label{fig:type2_ed}}
\end{figure}

With respect to Procrustes residuals (\autoref{fig:type2_sym}), tests
using either MHI or RV have reduced power regardless of effect or sample
size. Sampling from size-free correlation distributions to build
$\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices also has little effect. In this case, power for
tests performed using RV values approaches an identity relationship with
significance level; increasing sample size has some effect, but it does
not increase power above 50\% in any case.

to the legend. The solid black line represents the identity
relationship. \label{fig:type2_sym}}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Covariance matrices derived from morphological traits are supposed to
represent the pattern of codependence that arises due to a variety of
interactions among developing morphological elements. Such interactions
are the expression of local developmental factors, as they interact with
the expression profiles of surrounding cell types, producing coordinated
changes in their cell cycles, thus integrating resulting tissues in the
adult population. Although these events of local integration overlap,
and the composed effect over adult covariance patterns may be confusing
(Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008; Hallgrímsson et al. 2009), we believe
that a careful comparison of different yet equally proper ways of
measuring and representing form may be informative of the underlying
processes that produce covariances.

Due to the minimization of quadratic distances among homologous
landmarks during GPA, covariance matrices derived from Procrustes
estimators lose the signal of localized effects on covariance patterns
(Linde and Houle 2009). Therefore, the use of Procrustes estimators to
investigate morphological integration or modularity implicitly implies
in a divorce between the phenomenom we would like to investigate and the
representation we choose to use. This disconnection between theory and
measurement may have grave consequences for the hypotheses we wish to
test (Houle et al. 2011); such consequences are observable in both our
empirical tests and those tests performed on theoretical matrices, as we
explore below.

The mammalian Basicranium originates from thirteen precursor tissues
derived from both paraxial mesoderm and neural crest, and they may merge
to form single bones, such as the sphenoid (Jiang et al. 2002; Lieberman
2011). Furthermore, these precursors display a mosaic of endochondral
and intramembranous ossification early in development, and, as the brain
grows afterwards, it induces a pattern of internal resorption and
exterior deposition on the underlying posterior Basicranium (Lieberman
et al. 2000); meanwhile, the anterior portion suffers influence from the
development of Facial elements (Bastir and Rosas 2005). Thus, since the
Basicranium ossifies early in development, the composed effect of all
posterior steps of cranial development will overshadow any pattern of
integration this region might have, as predicted by the palimpsest model
of development (Hallgrímsson et al. 2009). Moreover, the angulation
between anterior and posterior elements of the Basicranium has changed
sensibly during primate evolution, and such property appears to have
evolved in coordination with Facial growth relative to the cranial
Vault, accomodating both structures on each other (Scott 1958; Lieberman
et al. 2000, 2008).

Due to this heterogeneity of developmental processes acting on the
Basicranium, we would not expect it to be a variational module, further
expecting that a test of this property over skull covariance patterns
will fail to reject the null hypothesis of random association. However,
considering the 42 tests performed over covariance matrices derived from
Procrustes residuals regarding localized hypotheses (midpanels of
\autoref{fig:Func}a), the Basicranium is detected as a valid variational
module in 27 cases, distributed through matrices with size either
retained or removed; in some cases (e.g. \emph{Alouatta},
\emph{Cercopithecus}), only the Basicranium is detected. Thus,
Procrustes residuals show a pattern of detection of variational modules
opposite to the expectation for this particular test. In covariances
matrices derived from interlandmark distances (upper panels of
\autoref{fig:Func}a), the Basicranium is not detected a single time;
with local shape variables (lower panels of \autoref{fig:Func}a), the
Basicranium is detected only three out of 42 times.

These two remaining types of representations, interlandmark distances
and local shape variables, show patterns of detection of variational
modules that are both consistent to the expectations derived from
developmental and functional interactions and to the patterns emerging
from these representations when size variation is removed. Considering
that interlandmark distances are on a ratio scale, isometric variation
will be represented to a greater extent when compared to subtle
allometric relationships, due to the multiplicative nature of biological
growth (Huxley 1932). Therefore, the Oral trait set is detected as a
valid variational module, considering covariance matrices among
interlandmark distances (upper left panel of \autoref{fig:Func}a), since
this region is strongly affected by the induction of bone growth due to
muscular activity beginning in the pre-weaning period (Zelditch and
Carmichael 1989; Hallgrímsson et al. 2009). Furthermore, in these
matrices, allometric interactions are associated with the strength of
association between traits in Oral, Nasal, Zygomatic and Vault regions
in an evolutionary scale (Chapter 3); thus, allometric relationships
also play some role in the determination of covariance/correlation
patterns for other subregions, although such pattern may be masked in
interlandmark distances by the effect of isometric variation. On the
other hand, the patterns expressed in covariance/correlation matrices
for local shape variables are influenced by allometric relationships
defined on a proper scale (Jolicoeur 1963; Houle et al. 2011; Márquez et
al. 2012) and local developmental processes. Thus, they reflect this
association between integration and allometry.

By removing allometric effects from local shape variables (lower right
panel of \autoref{fig:Func}a), variational modularity can still be
detected in both Oral and Nasal regions, while in a number of species,
the Vault region is no longer detected as a variational module. Vault
integration may be achieved through both allometric relationships and
the effect of relative brain growth, since Vault elements arise mostly
through intramembranous ossification, induced by the secretion of
signaling factors from the outer brain tissues, with a modest but
necessary contribution of mesoderm-derived tissue that undergoes
endochondral ossification (Jiang et al. 2002; Rice et al. 2003;
Franz-Odendaal 2011; Lieberman 2011). In humans, the growth of Vault
osteological elements occur, from a topological standpoint, without
deviations from an isometric growth model, forming regular connections
among bones (Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman 2014), since the boundary
of interactions between the tissue inducing growth (brain) and the
tissue whose growth is being induced (Vault bones) is also regular.
Thus, as this effect dominates the latter stages of pre-natal
development (Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008; Lieberman 2011), the
overall effect of brain growth over skull growth patterns in this stage
may mirror an affine transformation, rendering it undetectable over
covariance patterns derived from local shape variables, since their
estimation excludes shape variation associated with affine
transformations (Márquez et al. 2012). In contrast, Oral and Nasal
elements have more complex patterns of connectivity arising from their
tight integration with the soft tissues that compose the remaining
elements of the Face (Lieberman 2011; Esteve-Altava et al. 2013;
Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman 2014), thus producing an intrincate
pattern of associations that may be responsible for the variational
modularity we are able to detect in all species, regardless of whether
size variation is retained or removed.

The differences between the pattern of detection in all representations
for local trait sets for RV values (\autoref{fig:Func}b) makes a similar
interpretation of the results for this metric difficult, as opposed to
the results regarding MHI values. The variance of RV values among
species seems to indicate that RV values are sensitive to the magnitude
of morphological integration, as \emph{Papio} and \emph{Macaca} are
among the Catarrhines who display large values of this quantity
(Oliveira et al. 2009) and score higher (orange/red) RV values for all
local trait sets, at least when we consider interlandmark distances.
Such sensitivity might be one of the factors responsible for the low
power estimated for the RV metric using theoretical covariance matrices;
interestingly enough, this effect of magnitude of integration (which is
thought to emerge as a consequence of size variation; Wagner 1984;
Marroig and Cheverud 2001, 2005; Porto et al. 2013) seems to also affect
Procrustes residuals regardless of whether covariance structure arising
from allometric relationships is removed or not.

However, for the set of hypotheses concerning differences between Facial
and Neurocranial traits (\autoref{fig:Dev}), there is substantial
agreement between tests performed using MHI and RV values. For MHI
values (\autoref{fig:Dev}a), the overall pattern of detection is similar
to the pattern detected in local trait sets, for all variable types; for
RV values (\autoref{fig:Dev}b), there is ample support for the
hypotheses that both Face and Neurocranium represent variational
modules, in both local shape variables and interlandmark distances.
These regions have marked differences in timing and pattern formation
during development, as observed from the behavior of their composing
units (Zelditch and Carmichael 1989; Hallgrímsson et al. 2009; Lieberman
2011; Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman 2014); therefore, the more
general pattern of distinction between Face and Neurocranium is detected
regardless of the metric chosen to represent modularity.

\subsection{Theoretical Matrices and Error
Rates}\label{theoretical-matrices-and-error-rates}

The distribution of MHI and RV values obtained from the theoretical
matrices (\autoref{fig:stat_dist_sim}) is a starting point for
understanding the differences in power for tests using these two metrics
(Figures \ref{fig:type2_def}--\ref{fig:type2_sym}). For MHI values, the
distribution obtained from random ($\mathbf{C}_r$) matrices is
consistently the same, regardless of what representation we used to
sample correlations, or whether size was retained or removed. On the
other hand, the distribution of RV values for random matrices change
depending on the representation sampled or whether size variation has
been removed or retained. Moreover, this change in behavior for the
distribution of RV values for $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices implies different
levels of overlap between these null distributions and the distribution
of values obtained for structured ($\mathbf{C}_s$) matrices.

For Procrustes residuals, a substantial overlap occurs regardless of
whether size variation was removed or retained; unsurprisingly, our
estimates of power for RV in this type of representation are very low
(\autoref{fig:type2_sym}); nonetheless, power estimated for tests based
on MHI is lower than in other types of representation, since the
difference between within-set and between-set correlations in Procrustes
residuals (\autoref{fig:cor_dist}) is the lowest of all representations.
A substantial overlap in RV distributions for $\mathbf{C}_r$ and
$\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices also occurs with interlandmark distances when
size variation is removed, and it implies in low power for tests using
RV values in this type of representation (right column of
\autoref{fig:type2_ed}). However, in this case there is a substantial
difference between within-set and between-set correlations
(\autoref{fig:cor_dist}), and tests using MHI to represent modularity
are still able to detect such difference (albeit with reduced power)
when compared to tests over $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices derived from
interlandmark distances with size retained (\autoref{fig:type2_ed}). In
those cases where both distributions for $\mathbf{C}_r$ and
$\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices do not overlap substantially --- for example,
when local shape variables are considered (\autoref{fig:type2_def}) ---
power for tests performed using MHI values is always higher than for
tests using RV except when sample sizes are very high; in this case
power for both metrics are similar. The same behavior can also be
observed in interlandmark distances when size is retained (left column
of \autoref{fig:type2_ed}).

These results indicate that RV coefficents are more sensitive to the
absolute value of both within-set and between-set correlation
distributions than MHI values. For interlandmark distances
(\autoref{fig:type2_ed}), removing size variation reduced the average
value of both correlation distributions by a similar amount
(\autoref{fig:cor_dist}); the difference between average correlations in
these two sets actually increases, going from 0.042 to 0.061 when size
is removed. However, since the actual average correlations for these two
distributions approach zero, tests based on RV lose power more rapidly
than tests based on MHI. This sensitivity might be associated to the use
of squared covariances, as shown by Equation \ref{eq:rv}, while
Modularity Hypothesis Indexes use correlations directly (Equation
\ref{eq:mi}). Furthermore, as observed by Fruciano et al. (2013), sample
sizes sensibly influence the estimation of RV coefficients, and we
demostrate here that such sensitivity also extends to estimates of power
for tests using this metric.

On the other hand, our estimates of power for tests using MHI indicate
that it is more robust to differences in absolute correlation values or
sample sizes, thus allowing comparisons across more heterogeneous
settings, such as our comparison between different representations of
form, with substantial variation in sample sizes. The detection of
variational modularity is akin to Student's \emph{t} test, since we are
trying to determine whether two groups of observations (correlations
between traits in the same subset \emph{versus} correlations between
traits in different subsets) have a significant difference in average
values; we use resampling procedures to estimate significance in this
case only due to the interdependency between pairwise correlations.
Thus, as Modularity Hypothesis Indexes are estimated with a formula that
is very similar to that of a \emph{t} statistic (difference between
location parameters for two groups, divided by a scale parameter ---
ICV; Equation \ref{eq:mi}), we believe that this statistic is a proper
way to represent variational modularity; the robustness of the tests
using this statistic reinforce this belief.

Our approach for constructing theoretical matrices attempts to simulate
the most simple situation, that is, the situation where there are only
two subsets of traits, akin to the distinction between Face and
Neurocranium in our empirical dataset (\autoref{fig:Dev}). In this
setting, both statistics are capable of detecting this distinction,
except when both are used on covariance/correlation patterns derived
from Procrustes residuals. However, even though we built theoretical
matrices using correlations sampled from these estimators, actually
simulating the interference in covariance structure that such estimators
produce in our theoretical matrices is quite difficult. Thus, the lack
of differences in type I error rates for all cases may be a limitation
of our scheme for building correlation matrices.

The issues we found with the use of Procrustes estimators for covariance
matrices and the use of RV coefficients to estimate and detect
variational modularity may explain results found by other authors; for
instance, Martínez-Abadías et al. (2011) has found no evidence that
genetic and phenotypic covariance structure for human skulls conforms to
a modular structure, since all tests performed by these authors failed
to reject the null hypothesis of random association. These authors use
Procrustes estimators to represent covariance structure, and test their
hypothesis of partitioning (Face, Vault and Base) using RV as the
statistic representing variational modularity. Since this combination
implies in very low power (\autoref{fig:type2_sym}), not rejecting the
null hypothesis in their case might be a consequence of the choice of
estimates of both covariance structure and variational modularity; thus,
these authors' assertion of pervasive genetic integration in the human
skull may be misleading, considering that skull covariance patterns in
humans are one of the most modular examples of such patterns when
compared to other mammals (Porto et al. 2009) or catarrhine primates
(Oliveira et al. 2009).

The approach we explore in the present work is but one of the different
ways one can investigate the association between genetic, functional and
developmental interactions and correlation structure (Mitteroecker and
Bookstein 2007). For example, Perez et al. (2009) relies on abstracting
correlation matrices into networks, then using community-detection
algorithms to search for modular patterns without \emph{a priori}
hypotheses, associating their results with knockout experiments that
support the communities they found among traits; however, it is not
clear how much relevant information is retained in these network
representations. Furthermore, the authors use Procrustes estimators,
which may bias the detection of modularity patterns in this setting in
the same manner as we demonstrated here.

Monteiro et al. (2005) assumes that the underlying morphogenetic
components of the rodent mandible behave as modules, further
investigating the patters of correlation between these units in both
within-species variation and between-species variation among Echimids;
Monteiro and Nogueira (2010), relying on the correspondence of these
units through mammalian diversification did the same to phylostomid
bats. Although using a landmark-based approach to represent
morphological variation, the authors do not use Procrustes estimators to
represent covariance structure among these units, and the pattern of
reorganization of correlation structure among these units associated
with niche diversification in phylostomids seems robust, considering
that this radiation may have been associated with a very heterogeneous
adaptive landscape, and such heterogeneity may lead to a reorganization
of correlation patterns (Jones 2007; Jones et al. 2012; Melo and Marroig
2015).

Another valid approach is to model certain aspects of development as
null hypotheses; Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman (2014), investigating
the pattern of connections among human cranial bones, conceived the null
hypothesis that unconstrained bone growth is sufficient to explain the
observed patterns. Such approach could be extended to investigate
morphological covariance structure; if we consider the geometric
properties of the features we measure (Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2007),
one could formulate the null hypothesis that topological proximity is a
sufficient explanation for the observed covariance structure, against
the alternative hypothesis that local developmental processes coupled
with functional interactions produce stronger relationships among close
elements that surpass these purely topological interactions.
Alternatively, one could actively look for variational boundaries
between regions, as boundary formation is a phenomenom that has been
well studied under a dynamical perspective on development (e.g. Turing
1952; Meinhardt 1983; Tiedemann et al. 2012).

The approach of partitioning covariance matrices into blocks that
correspond to inferred modular associations has the advantage that it is
simple from an operational standpoint; however, modularity patterns are
almost certainly not expressed in phenotypic data as the binary
hypotheses we used here (Hallgrímsson et al. 2009). Thus, hypotheses and
inferences made from them have to be contextualized in the light of
developmental dynamics, since the measurements we make and the
parameters we estimate have to be properly connected to the models we
are considering; otherwise, inferences made from such models may be
devoid of meaning (Wagner 2010; Houle et al. 2011).

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Here we show that Procrustes estimators for covariance matrices fail to
capture the modularity patterns embedded in phenotypic data, regardless
of which metric is chosen to represent such patterns. Either
interlandmark distances and local shape variables seem valid options to
represent morphological variation, if their limitations are taken into
consideration. We wish to stress this point: any representation of
morphological variation has limitations, as such representations are
themselves models --- at the very least, of what it is important to
represent --- not fully capturing the phenomena we may be interested in.
