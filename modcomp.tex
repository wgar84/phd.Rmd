\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

The study of modularity in morphological systems has increased in the
past twenty years, parallel to the popularization of geometric
morphometrics; as a consequence of this popularization, different
operational criteria for detecting modularity using landmark-based data
have been proposed. However, compared to the usual covariance matrix
estimators, Procrustes-based estimators have properties that hinder
their use in this context. Here, we compare different representations of
organismal form, focusing on tests for detecting \emph{a priori} defined
modularity patterns; we also compare two metrics that represent
modularity: one derived from linear morphometrics (MHI) and another that
emerged in the context of landmark-based representations (RV). With a
dataset of Anthropoid skulls, we compare tests using both metrics over
three representations of form: interlandmark distances, Procrustes
residuals, and local shape variables. Tests using either metrics over
Procrustes residuals fail to detect modularity patterns, while remaining
representations show the distinction between early- and late-development
in mammalian skull ontogeny. To estimate error rates, we built
covariance matrices of known structure, testing hypotheses over then;
such tests indicate that power for tests using MHI is more stable
considering effect and sample sizes; when using RV, power is sensitive
to these parameters. However, both statistics have low power when used
on matrices whose correlation distribution derives from Procrustes
residuals. These results indicate that the influence of development and
function is poorly represented on Procrustes estimators for covariance
matrices, regardless of the measurement used to represent modularity.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Modularity is a characteristic property that biological systems exhibit
concerning the distribution of interactions between their composing
elements; that is, in a given system, certain subsets of elements,
denominated modules, interact more among themselves than with other such
subsets (Newman 2006; Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2007; Wagner et al.
2007). This has been well documented at different levels of biological
organization, from the dynamics of metabolic networks (e.g. Ravasz et
al. 2002; Andrade et al. 2011) to the structure of interactions among
individuals in populations (e.g. Fortuna et al. 2008) and among species
in ecological communities (e.g. Genini et al. 2010).

Regarding morphological systems, the concept of modularity is associated
with the framework of morphological integration (Olson and Miller 1958;
Cheverud 1996), which refers to the organization of covariances or
correlations among morphological elements and the hypotheses concerning
their biological relationships. In this context, modularity refers to
the uneven distribution of genetic effects over phenotypic variation
articulated through development (genotype/phenotype map; Wagner 1996);
in a classical quantitative genetics view these shared genetic effects
are the result of pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium (Falconer and
Mackay 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998). A genotype/phenotype map composed of
clusters of genes that affect clusters of traits (with little overlap
among groups) exhibits a modular organization, and such structure is
thought to emerge as the result of selection for distinct functional
demands (Wagner and Altenberg 1996; Espinosa-Soto and Wagner 2010;
Rueffler et al. 2012; Melo and Marroig 2015). For instance, the
decoupling between fore- and hindlimb function in certain mammalian
lineages such as bats (Young and Hallgrímsson 2005) and apes (Young et
al. 2010) is associated with the modularization of both structures, as
shown by a reduction of phenotypic correlations among limbs and an
increase in correlations within limbs.

The recognition of variational modules (Wagner and Altenberg 1996;
Wagner et al. 2007) over covariance or correlation patterns in adult
populations involves a comprehension of the underlying developmental and
functional dynamics among morphological traits (Polly 2008; Zelditch and
Swiderski 2011). In the mammalian skull for example, development is
composed of a series of steps, such as neurocranial growth induced by
the underlying developing brain and growth mediated by muscle-bone
interactions, with a considerate degree of spatiotemporal overlapping
among them (Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008; Herring 2011; Cardini and
Polly 2013). The regulation of both timing and scope of each step is
mediated by different profiles of genetic expression exhibited by cells
originated from different embryonic precursors and their response to
signaling factors expressed at the regional level; the response to these
signaling factors further changes the expression profile in the affected
cells, thus generating a feedback loop of cell and tissue diferentiation
(Turing 1952; Marcucio et al. 2005; Meinhardt 2008; Hallgrímsson et al.
2009; Franz-Odendaal 2011; Minelli 2011). Each step in this temporal
hierarchy may be regarded as modular, in the sense that they affect a
coherent subset of tissues more so than others (Hallgrímsson and
Lieberman 2008), although each step affect adjoining regions through
interactions among developing tissues (Cheverud et al. 1992; Lieberman
2011; Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman 2014); thus, the association
between correlation patterns and ontogenetic processes may be
complicated by the overlapping of such processes through the course of
development (Hallgrímsson et al. 2009).

Furthermore, variation in overall growth rates which in adult
populations produces the emergence of size variation (Porto et al. 2013;
Pélabon et al. 2013), has a particular importance in the context of
mammalian morphological systems; here size variation refers to variation
in both scale (isometric variation) and scale relationships (allometric
variation). This source of variation affects the overall level of
phenotypic correlations among morphological traits (Wagner 1984; Young
and Hallgrímsson 2005), and the magnitude of integration has important
consequences for both the evolution of mean phenotypes among species
(Schluter 1996; Marroig and Cheverud 2005, 2010; Cardini and Polly 2013)
and the evolution of morphological integration itself (Oliveira et al.
2009; Porto et al. 2009, 2013; Shirai and Marroig 2010).

Considerations based on theoretical (e.g. Lande 1980; Pavlicev et al.
2010), experimental (Pavlicev et al. 2008, 2011; e.g. Hallgrímsson et
al. 2009) or simulation-based approaches (e.g. Jones 2007; Jones et al.
2012; Watson et al. 2013; Melo and Marroig 2015) point out that
integration patterns evolve to a equilibrium state dictated by the
effect of pleiotropic mutations and selective regimes; thus, changes in
integration patterns will be a consequence of changes in one of these
components. In this context, adaptive landscapes may be the central
component governing both the stability and divergence in integration
patterns, as both stabilizing (Jones 2007; Arnold et al. 2008) and
directional (Jones et al. 2012; Melo and Marroig 2015) selection have
been shown to produce changes in integration patterns.

Moreover, in the past twenty years, there has been a consistent effort
in measuring covariance and correlation patterns in different organisms
and morphological structures at different phylogenetic scales, a
research program named ``comparative quantitative genetics'' by Steppan
et al. (2002). The empirical evidence available demonstrates that both
stability (e.g. Marroig and Cheverud 2001; Oliveira et al. 2009; Porto
et al. 2009; Willmore et al. 2009) and divergence (e.g. Monteiro and
Nogueira 2010; Grabowski et al. 2011; Sanger et al. 2012; Haber 2015) of
integration patterns are possible outcomes of the evolutionary process.
Therefore, the question of whether any of these two scenarios is the
rule or exception at macroevolutionary scales remains open, although
some theoretical and methodological differences between these works with
respect to the representation of morphological features need to be taken
into consideration.

\subsubsection{Morphometrics}\label{morphometrics}

Traditionally, morphological traits and features are measured using
distances among elements defined in general terms, such as ``cranial
length'' or ``cranial width''. Pearson and Davin (1924) introduced the
notion that such measurements should be restricted to single
osteological elements, preferably as distances between homologous
features that could be identified in a wide taxonomic coverage. Cheverud
(1982) accomodates this notion into the framework of morphological
integration, thus considering individual measurements over bones are
local representations of regional phenomena, that is, the functional,
developmental and genetic interactions that produce covariances among
these elements. The influence of such interactions over covariance or
correlation matrices can then be accessed by defining a subset of
measurements which fall under the scope of a particular process and
further estimating a metric that summarizes such partitioning; the null
hypothesis that this partition is undistinguishable from
randomly-defined partitions can be tested using randomization procedures
(Mantel 1967; Cheverud et al. 1989).

In the past three decades, geometric morphometrics (Bookstein 1982,
1991; Kendall 1984; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Goodall 1991) have been
consolidated as a quantitative framework for the representation of
biological shape as geometric configurations of homologous features
(landmarks; Bookstein 1991). Two principles are central to this
framework: first, the conceptual and statistical separation of size and
shape as the main components of biological form; second, the use of
superimposition-based methods (GPA: Generalized Procrustes Analysis;
Rohlf and Slice 1990; Goodall 1991) for the estimation of shape
statistical parameters, such as mean shape and shape covariance
structure. Procrustes estimators were proposed as a solution to the
problem that landmark configurations are arbitrarily rotated and
translated; such nuisance parameters are impossible to estimate without
any assumptions (Goodall 1991; Lele and McCulloch 2002), a situation
known as the identifiability problem (Neyman and Scott 1948).

Although the use of Procrustes estimators is currently widespread in
geometric morphometrics toolboxes (e.g. Klingenberg 2011; Adams and
Otárola-Castillo 2013), it has not been without criticisms, either with
respect to the estimation of mean shape configurations (e.g. Lele 1993;
Kent and Mardia 1997; Huckemann 2012) and of shape covariance matrices
(Walker 2000; Adams et al. 2004; Linde and Houle 2009; Márquez et al.
2012). For shape configurations in two-dimensional space, Procrustes
estimators for mean shape have been shown to perform well under
isotropic landmark covariance structure (Kent and Mardia 1997), that is,
a situation of null covariances among landmarks and coordinates;
however, when such assumption does not hold Procrustes estimates for
mean shape may behave badly, especially in situations where shape
variation is high (Huckemann 2011). The simple example provided by Linde
and Houle (2009) demonstrates that when such assumption is broken shape
covariance patterns are also poorly estimated; if the unknown landmark
covariance matrix is structured due to regional differences in
covariance-generating processes, such variation will be displaced and
effectively spread out through the entire landmark configuration when
GPA is used.

A number of alternatives for dealing with the estimation of shape
covariance matrices have been proposed; some of these alternatives (e.g.
Monteiro et al. 2005; Theobald and Wuttke 2006; Zelditch et al. 2009;
Linde and Houle 2009) propose modifications to the Procrustes analysis
in order to deal with heterogeneity in landmark covariance structure.
The approach advocated by Márquez et al. (2012) proposes another
definition of shape descriptors using interpolation-based techniques
(Cheverud and Richtsmeier 1986; Bookstein 1989) as a starting point;
such descriptors refer to infinitesimal expansions or retractions in
reference to a unknown mean shape (Woods 2003) estimated at definite
locations amidst sampled landmarks. Márquez et al. (2012) argue that
such descriptors are proper local measurements of shape variation, as
they can directly be linked to biological processes that generate
covariation among morphological elements.

Despite these methodological caveats regarding Procrustes estimators for
covariance matrices, the use of such estimators for investigating
aspects of morphological integration has increased in the past ten years
(e.g. Klingenberg et al. 2004; Goswami and Polly 2010; Drake and
Klingenberg 2010; Martínez-Abadías et al. 2011; Sanger et al. 2012). The
results found by these authors are sometimes in stark constrast with
similar works using interlandmark distances (e.g. Cheverud et al. 1997;
Oliveira et al. 2009; Porto et al. 2009). For instance, Martínez-Abadías
et al. (2011) found a pattern of strong integration among partitions in
human skull covariance patterns, while Oliveira et al. (2009) and Porto
et al. (2009) demonstrated that humans are among the most modular
examples of mammalian skull covariance patterns. Likewise, Klingenberg
et al. (2004) has found no evidence for a modular distribution of
pleiotropic effects among the partitions of the mouse mandible; using
the same strain of intercrossed mice at the same generation, Cheverud et
al. (1997) had shown that 70\% of the pleiotropic effects are confined
to either anterior or posterior mandibular components, while the
remaining 30\% are shared among the two regions. Furthermore, aside from
the issues regarding Procrustes estimators, these works also propose
different methods to quantify the effects of interactions over
covariance patterns. For example, Martínez-Abadías et al. (2011) and
Sanger et al. (2012) use the RV coefficient, a multivariate correlation
coefficient defined by Escoufier (1973) which has been used to quantify
modular relationships over landmark covariance patterns since
Klingenberg (2009) has proposed its use in this context.

\subsubsection{Objectives}\label{objectives}

In the present work, we compare the methods described by Cheverud et al.
(1989) and Klingenberg (2009) to test \emph{a priori} defined modularity
patterns using anthropoid primates as a model organism. In order to also
compare the performance of these methods with respect to different
representations of form, individuals in our sample are represented both
as interlandmark distances and shape variables. Furthermore, we also
used an approach based on the construction of theoretical covariance
matrices; such matrices are used in order to estimate Type I and Type II
error rates for both methods. Since these methods were designed under
different frameworks, the present work also puts some effort into
unifying both methods into the same conceptual and statistical
framework, in order to produce meaningful comparisons.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Sample}\label{sample}

The database we used here (\autoref{tab:modcomp_otu}) consists of 21
species, distributed across all taxonomic ranks within Anthropoidea
above the genus level. We selected these species from a broader database
(Marroig and Cheverud 2001; Oliveira et al. 2009) in order to reduce the
effects of low sample sizes over estimates of modularity patterns.
Individuals in our sample are represented by 36 registered landmarks,
measured using a Polhemus 3Draw (for Platyrrhini) and a Microscribe 3DS
(for Catarrhini). Twenty-two unique landmarks represent each individual
(\autoref{fig:landmarks}, \autoref{tab:lms}), since 14 of the 36
registered landmarks are bilaterally symmetrical. For more details on
landmark registration, see Marroig and Cheverud (2001) and Oliveira et
al. (2009).

\input{Tables/modcomp_otu}

For each OTU, we estimated phenotypic covariance and correlation
matrices for three different types of variables: tangent space
residuals, estimated from a Procrustes superimposition for the entire
sample, using the set of landmarks described on both \autoref{tab:lms}
and \autoref{fig:landmarks} (henceforth refered to as Procrustes
residuals); interlandmark distances, as described in \autoref{tab:dist};
and local shape variables (Márquez et al. 2012), which are measurements
of infinitesimal log volume transformations between each sample unit and
a reference (mean) shape, based upon an interpolation function that
describes shape variation between sampled landmarks. In this context, we
use thin plate splines as the interpolating function (Bookstein 1989).
These transformations were calculated at 38 points, corresponding to the
locations of the mipoints between pairs of landmarks used to calculate
interlandmark distances, in order to produce a dataset that represents
shape (i.e., form without isometric variation; Bookstein 1991; Zelditch
et al. 2004) while retaining the same overall properties of the
interlandmark distance dataset such as dimensionality for example.
Furthermore, we were able to use the same hypotheses of trait
associations for both types of variables since the position of local
shape variables through the skull mirrors the position of interlandmark
distances, although they are conceptually different types of
measurements.

Here we considered only covariance or correlation structure for the
symmetrical component of variation; therefore, prior to any analysis, we
controlled the effects of variation in assymmetry. For interlandmark
distances, we averaged bilateral measurements within each individual.
For both Procrustes residuals and local shape variables, we followed the
procedure outlined in Klingenberg et al. (2002) for bilateral structures
by obtaning for each individual a symmetrical landmark configuration,
averaging each actual shape with its reflection along the sagittal
plane; we estimate local shape variables afterwards. With respect to
Procrustes residuals, landmarks placed along the sagittal plane will
have zero variation in the direction normal to this plane; we aligned
all specimens' sagittal plane to the $xz$ plane, thus removing the $y$
component for each of these landmarks from covariance/correlation
matrices.

For each dataset, we estimated covariance and correlation matrices after
removing fixed effects of little interest in the present context, such
as sexual dimorphism, for example. For interlandmark distances and local
shape variables these effects were removed through a multivariate linear
model adjusted for each species, according to \autoref{tab:modcomp_otu};
for Procrustes residuals, the same effects were removed by centering all
group means to each species' mean shape since the loss of degrees of
freedom imposed by the GPA prohibits the use of a full multivariate
linear model over this kind of data to remove fixed effects.

In order to consider the effects of size variation over modularity
patterns we used a different procedure to remove the influence of size,
according to the different properties of each type of variable. For
interlandmark distances we used the approach established by Bookstein et
al. (1985); if $\mathbf{C}$ is a correlation matrix, we obtained a
correlation matrix $\mathbf{R}$ without the effect of size using the
equation

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{C} - \lambda_1 v_1 v^{t}_1
\label{eq:iso}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_1$ and $v_1$ refer respectively to the first eigenvalue
and eigenvector of the spectral decomposition of $\mathbf{C}$,
considering that this eigenvector is associated with size variation,
which is a common pattern in mammalian correlation structure, especially
when interlandmark distances are considered (Wagner 1984; Mitteroecker
et al. 2004; Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2007); $t$ denotes matrix
transpose.

For Procrustes residuals and local shape variables the effects of
isometric variation were removed by normalizing each individual to unit
centroid size. However, allometric effects still influence covariance or
correlation structure. In order to remove such effects we used a
procedure similar to that of interlandmark distances, based upon
Mitteroecker et al. (2004), which relies on the estimation of an
allometric component for each OTU; this allometric component is composed
of regression coefficents for each of the $m$ shape variables (either
Procrustes residuals or local shape variables) over log Centroid Size.
If $\mathbf{S}$ is a covariance matrix, we obtained a covariance matrix
$\mathbf{R}$ without the influence of allometric relationships using the
equation

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = (I_m - aa^t) \mathbf{S} (I_m - aa^t)
\label{eq:allo}
\end{equation}

where $a$ refers to the normalized allometric component estimated for
each OTU and $I_m$ represents the identity matrix of size $m$.
Therefore, our empirical dataset consists of six different sets of
covariance/correlation matrices, considering both the nature of
morphometric variables and the presence or absence of variation
associated with size.

\subsection{Empirical Modularity Hypothesis
Tests}\label{empirical-modularity-hypothesis-tests}

Using these six sets of covariance/correlation matrices, we tested the
hypotheses of trait associations described in both \autoref{tab:lms} for
Procrustes residuals and \autoref{tab:dist} for interlandmark distances
and local shape variables. These trait sets are grouped with respect to
their scope; two regional sets (Face and Neurocranium), each divided
into three more localized trait sets (Oral, Nasal and Zygomatic for the
Face; Orbit, Base and Vault for the Neurocranium).

For all hypotheses, we estimated both Modularity Hypothesis Indexes
(MHI; Porto et al. 2013) and the RV coefficient (Klingenberg 2009). Both
statistics are estimated by partitioning any given covariance or
correlation matrix into blocks; if $\mathbf{A}$ is a covariance or
correlation matrix, the partition \[
\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{A}_h & \mathbf{A}_b \\
\mathbf{A}^t_b & \mathbf{A}_c
\end{bmatrix}
\] indicates that the block $\mathbf{A}_h$ contains covariances or
correlations between traits that belong to the trait set being
considered, while $\mathbf{A}_c$ represents the complementary trait set;
$\mathbf{A}_b$ represents the block of covariances or correlations
between the two sets. Thus, covariance ($\mathbf{S}$) or correlation
($\mathbf{C}$) matrices can be partitioned into a similar scheme. We
estimated Modularity Hypothesis Indexes using the equation

\begin{equation}
MHI = \frac {\bar{\rho}_{+} - \bar{\rho}_{-}} {ICV}
\label{eq:mi}
\end{equation}

where $\bar{\rho}_{+}$ represents the mean correlation in
$\mathbf{C}_h$, $\bar{\rho}_{-}$ represents the mean correlation in the
remaining sets (both $\mathbf{C}_b$ and $\mathbf{C}_c$), and $ICV$ is
the coefficient of variation of eigenvalues of the associated covariance
matrix, which is a measurement of the overall integration between all
traits (Shirai and Marroig 2010). We estimated RV coefficients for each
hypothesis using the relationship

\begin{equation}
RV = \frac{tr(\mathbf{S}_{b}\mathbf{S}^t_{b})}{\sqrt{tr(\mathbf{S}_h \mathbf{S}_h)tr(\mathbf{S}_c \mathbf{S}_c)}}
\label{eq:rv}
\end{equation}

where $tr$ represents the sum of diagonal elements in any given matrix
($tr \mathbf{A} = \sum_i a_{ii}$).

The partitioning scheme outlined above assumes that the complementary
trait set does not represent an actual hypothesis of association;
however, we may choose to consider that both sets ($\mathbf{A}_h$ and
$\mathbf{A}_c$) represent two distinct hypothesis. The estimation of RV
coefficients remains the same; however, Modularity Hypothesis Indexes
are estimated considering that $\bar{\rho}_{+}$ is the average
correlation in both $\mathbf{C}_h$ and $\mathbf{C}_c$, while
$\bar{\rho}_{-}$ represents the average correlation only in
$\mathbf{C}_b$. In the particular case of the distinction between Facial
and Neurocranial traits, we also estimated MHI values in this manner,
reporting values for this estimate under the denomination `Neuroface',
following Marroig and Cheverud (2001), along independent MHI estimates
for each region. Furthermore, since both Face and Neurocranium are two
disjoint trait sets when any morphometric variable type is considered,
RV coefficient values for either set are equal; therefore, a single RV
value is reported for both regions, for each variable type.

In order to test the hypothesis that a particular trait set represents a
variational module, we used a randomization procedure that generates
1000 random trait sets with the same number of traits as the original
set, calculating MHI and RV values for each iteration. For each trait
set and covariance/correlation matrix, such values were used to
construct distributions for both statistics that represent the null
hypothesis that a given trait set is a random arrangement without
meaningful relationships; the value obtained for the real trait set is
then compared to this null distribution. For Modularity Hypothesis
Indexes we consider that this null hypothesis is rejected when the real
value is higher than the average value obtained from the distribution,
considering the significance level established; for RV coefficients, the
null hypothesis is rejected when the real RV value is lower than the
average value for the distribution, also considering a certain
significance level. For Procrustes residuals the randomization procedure
considers that coordinates within the same landmark should remain
together in each randomly generated trait set, following Klingenberg and
Leamy (2001).

It is noteworthy that, while the procedure for estimating significance
in the case of Modularity Hypothesis Indexes is derived from Mantel's
(1967) approach (as outlined by Cheverud et al. 1989), we chose to
generate null distributions for MHI directly, instead of estimating
matrix correlation values for both real and permutated matrices.
Estimated $p$-values in both cases remained the same, and the additional
step of estimating matrix correlations would produce an unnecessary
difference between the estimation of signficance for MHI and RV.

\subsection{Estimation of Error Rates}\label{estimation-of-error-rates}

In order to evaluate the statistical properties of both statistics and
the randomization procedure, we built theoretical correlation matrices
\[
\mathbf{C}_{s} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{W}_1 & \mathbf{B} \\
\mathbf{B}^t & \mathbf{W}_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\] where $\mathbf{W}_1$ and $\mathbf{W}_2$ represent correlation blocks
associated with two distinct trait sets, and $\mathbf{B}$ represents the
correlation block between both sets.

For each correlation matrix in our empirical dataset, we estimated
average correlations within and between all trait sets we considered,
thus obtaining a distribution of within and between sets correlations
associated with each type of morphometric variable (Procrustes
Residuals, Interlandmark Distances and Local Shape Variables), also
considering whether size was retained or removed
(\autoref{fig:cor_dist}). We constructed corresponding sets of
$\mathbf{C}_{s}$ matrices by sampling each distribution we obtained in
this manner; for each matrix, we sampled two within-set correlations and
one between-set correlation, filling the corresponding block
($\mathbf{W}_1$, $\mathbf{W}_2$ and $\mathbf{B}$) in each theoretical
matrix with the sampled correlation. For example, with only four traits
divided into two blocks of two traits, if we sample the values $0.5$ and
$0.3$ from the within-set distribution and $-0.1$ from the between-set
distribution, the corresponding $\mathbf{C}_{s}$ matrix will be \[
\mathbf{C}_s =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0.5 & -0.1 & -0.1 \\
0.5 & 1 & -0.1 & -0.1 \\
-0.1 & -0.1 & 1 & 0.3 \\
-0.1 & -0.1 & 0.3 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\] filling each cell in each block with the sampled correlation
associated with that particular block. Thus, we abstracted each type of
morphometric variable to a pair of correlation distributions
(\autoref{fig:cor_dist}), building six sets of theoretical correlation
matrices that are representative of each type (also considering the
presence or absence of size variation) which also retain their
statistical properties.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/cor_dist-1.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of within-set and between-set mean correlations
derived from the six types of empirical correlation matrices.
\label{fig:cor_dist}}
\end{figure}

For each of the six pairs of correlation distributions, we built 10000
theoretical correlation matrices for 40 traits; previous tests indicate
that matrix dimensionality does not qualitatively affect any of our
results. We also sampled variances from each different type of
morphometric variable, thus constructing an associated covariance
matrix, since the estimation of RV values uses covariance matrices. We
considered only positive-definite matrices; if any given matrix did not
fit this criterion, we discarded that matrix and sampled a new set of
correlations. This allows us to sample observations from a multivariate
normal distribution using each of these 60000 matrices as the $\Sigma$
parameter. For each matrix, we also randomly determine the number of
traits in both sets; we established a minimal value of five traits for
the size of any set.

We used this set of 60000 covariance matrices of known structure
($\mathbf{C}_s$) to built another set of covariance matrices of unknown,
random structure ($\mathbf{C}_r$) by simply shuffling both lines and
columns of each matrix; therefore, each $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrix is
associated with a $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrix. For all matrices
($\mathbf{C}_r$ and $\mathbf{C}_s$) we obtained samples of increasing
size (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 individuals) and re-estimated a covariance
matrix for each sample, thus also considering in our tests the
uncertainty derived from sampling. For each matrix estimated, both
$\mathbf{C}_r$ and $\mathbf{C}_s$, we test the hypothesis that the two
sets used to generate each $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrix represent two
variational modules, using both MHI and RV coefficients, as described in
the previous section.

The case in which samples were generated from a $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrix
represents a situation of a true null hypothesis for either tests, since
the correlation matrix used to produce the sample was generated by a
permutation of the hypothesis being tested. Therefore, testing
hypotheses over $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices allowed us to estimate Type I
error rates for both tests, that is, the proportion of cases in which
the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true, given a
significance level. In an adequate test, we expect that both quantities,
significance level and Type I error rate, will be identical.

The opposite case, when we sampled $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices, represents a
situation in which we know that the null hypothesis of either tests is
false, since we are testing the hypothesis that the partitioning scheme
used to generate that particular matrix actually represents two
variational modules. Thus, we estimated, in this case, the Type II error
rates, that is, the probability that the null hypothesis is not rejected
even though it is false, given a significance level; here, we represent
Type II error using the power for each test, by simply calculating the
complementar probability to Type II error rate. In an adequate test, we
expect that power will rapidly reach a plateau when significance level
is still close to zero, and further increasing $P(\alpha)$ will not
produce a great increase in power.

Our estimates of power for both statistics should also be controlled for
effect size, since sampled correlations may generate a correlation
structure that is not detected simply due to small differences between
within-set and between-set correlations. For each correlation matrix
sampled, we kept the squared between-set correlation ($b^2$), in order
to use it as an estimate of effect size that is not directly associated
with either MHI and RV statistics. We expect that power for either tests
decreases with increasing $b^2$ values, as effect size would also
decrease.

\subsubsection{Software}\label{software}

All analysis were performed under R 3.2.2 (R Core Team 2015). Source
code for all analyses can be found at \url{http://github.com/wgar84}. It
is noteworthy that previous tests we made indicated no differences
between our estimation of empirical RV coefficients, based upon our own
code, and estimates provided by MorphoJ (Klingenberg 2011). In order to
obtain symmetrical landmarks configurations, we used code provided by
Annat Haber, available at
\url{http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/soft-R.html}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Empirical Tests}\label{empirical-tests}

Tests performed using Modularity Hypothesis Indexes for localized trait
sets (Oral, Nasal, Zygomatic, Orbit, Base, and Vault;
\autoref{fig:Func}a) detect a consistent pattern among OTUs for both
interlandmark distances and local shape variables; in the first set the
Oral sub-region is detected as a modular partition, and, when size is
removed, the Vault sub-region is also detected; both Orbit and Base
region are not detected in any of the tests with this type of variable.
With local shape variables, both Oral and Vault sets were also detected
consistently across OTUs, along Nasal and Zygomatic traits; moreover,
the removal of allometric variation affects only the detection of the
Vault in some groups. Furthermore, the Base sub-region is detected only
in 3 of 42 tests performed over local shape variables, pooling together
both size and size-free correlation patterns. One source of difference
between local shape variables and interlandmark distances regarding the
detection of localized variational modules are the Hominoids
(\emph{Gorilla}. \emph{Homo}, \emph{Hylobates}, and \emph{Pan}), which
display a considerate heterogeneity in detected regions in interlandmark
distances; however, when considering local shape variables, a more
conserved pattern of detection is observed.

For Procrustes residuals, the pattern of detection among sub-regions and
OTUs is more diffuse; it is noteworthy that the Base sub-region is
detected among several OTUs, which contrasts this type of morphometric
variable with the remaining two types. Furthermore, abstracting the
actual tests performed, \autoref{fig:Func}a also indicates that
Procrustes residuals display a low variance for MHI values within each
OTU, while both interlandmark distances and local shape variables
display a consistent pattern of variation among MHI values within each
OTU, with lower values for the Base and, for interlandmark distances,
Orbit trait sets, while the Oral, Nasal and Vault regions display higher
values consistently.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{Figures/Func-1.pdf}
\caption{MHI (a) and RV (b) values for localized trait sets. Circles
indicate whether a trait set is recognized as a variational module in a
given OTU, with $P(\alpha)$ indicated by the legend. Notice that blue
values are associated with higher MHI values and lower RV values, as the
alternate hypothesis for each statistic is formulated in a corresponding
manner; see text for details. \label{fig:Func}}
\end{figure}

Tests performed using RV coefficients (\autoref{fig:Func}b) show a more
diffuse pattern among each variable type. When interlandmark distances
are considered, most tests detect the Vault sub-region with size
variation retained, and the Base sub-region when size variation is
removed. For Procrustes residuals, few tests are able to reject their
null hypotheses, detecting only a handful of valid modular partitions.
Tests performed on local shape variables display the opposite behavior:
almost all partitions are detected, regardless of whether allometric
variation has been retained or removed. Moreover, RV values display a
pattern of marked variation among OTUs, more so than between values
within each OTU; notably, \emph{Macaca fascicularis} and \emph{Papio
anubis} show RV values much higher than those estimated on remaining
species. This pattern can be observed both on interlandmark distances
with size retained and in Procrustes residuals, although this effect is
more marked in the former type.

With respect to regional trait sets (Face and Neurocranium), tests
performed using MHI (\autoref{fig:Dev}a) indicate a pattern consistent
with the findings regarding localized sets (\autoref{fig:Func}a).
Considering only interlandmark distances, Facial traits are detected as
a valid modular partition both with size variation retained or removed,
while Neurocranial traits are detected as a valid partition only when
size variation is removed. This pattern mirrors the contrast between
Oral and Vault traits in the localized sets regarding interlandmark
distances. Considering Procrustes residuals, Neurocranial traits are a
valid partition with both size retained and removed; once again, this
pattern mirrors the detection of the Basicranial partition as valid in
the localized sets. Finally, in local shape variables, both Face and
Neurocranium are detected as valid with size retained; with size
removed, only the Face is recognized consistently. The same can be
observed in the localized sets, where removing allometric variation
affects the detection of the Vault set in some OTUs. The tests for the
distinction of within-set and between-set correlations for these two
sets (designated `Neuroface') show a pattern that is consistent with
tests for the individual sets, that is, if one of the sets was
previously detected, this distinction is also detected as valid.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{MHI (a) and RV (b) values for regional trait sets. Circles
indicate whether a trait set is recognized in a given OTU, with

associated with higher MHI values and lower RV values, as the alternate
hypothesis for each statistic is formulated in a corresponding manner;
see text for details. \label{fig:Dev}}
\end{figure}

Tests performed for this distinction between Face and Neurocranium using
RV coefficients (\autoref{fig:Dev}b) show that in most cases, for both
interlandmark distances and local shape variables, both regions are
considered distinct and valid variational modules; in Procrustes
residuals only in a handful of taxa the same result can be observed. In
this case the correspondence with results for localized trait sets
(\autoref{fig:Func}b) is more difficult due to the lack of independent
tests for each region.

\subsection{Error Rates}\label{error-rates}

Comparing the distributions of MHI and RV values from theoretical
matrices with respect to their structure (\autoref{fig:stat_dist_sim})
shows marked differences between statistics and morphometric variables
from which correlations are sampled. For local shape variables the
distribution of both MHI and RV values for $\mathbf{C}_s$ and
$\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices overlap very little; for interlandmark distances
the distribution of MHI values for both matrix types also has little
overlap, while the same distributions for RV have a substantial overlap.
Finally, for Procrustes residuals, while the distribution of MHI values
for both matrix types overlap to some degree, the same distributions for
RV values are identical. It is noteworthy that removing size or
allometry does not change these distributions in most cases; only for RV
values estimated over matrices derived from correlation distributions
for interlandmark distances, in which the removal of size variation
increases the overlap in $\mathbf{C}_s$ and $\mathbf{C}_r$
distributions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/stat_dist_sim-1.pdf}
\caption{Distribution of Modularity Hypothesis Index and RV Coefficient
for theoretical correlation matrices. \label{fig:stat_dist_sim}}
\end{figure}

Regarding the relationship between significance levels and Type I error
rates estimated over $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices, \autoref{fig:type1} shows
that these quantities approach an identity relationship very closely
regardless of whether we use MHI or RV to quantify variational
modularity; even at low sample sizes Type I error rates are very close
to significance levels. Furthermore, the effect of sampling correlations
from size-free distributions does not alter Type I error rates for both
tests.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/type1-1.pdf}
\caption{Type I error rates as a function of the chosen significance
level regarding tests for variational modularity applied on
$\mathbf{C}_r$ correlation matrices. The solid black line represents the
identity relationship. \label{fig:type1}}
\end{figure}

When we consider the relationship between power and significance levels,
estimated over $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices, there are substantial
differences with respect both to the chosen statistic (MHI or RV) and to
the type of variable from which correlations are sampled. Considering
local shape variables (\autoref{fig:type2_def}), tests using either MHI
and RV have high power, even at low sample or effect sizes; increasing
these quantities produces a further increase in power. However, it is
noteworthy that, for lower effect sizes (represented by high average
squared correlation between sets, $b^2$) power for tests performed using
MHI is higher than for those using RV. As effect size increases (lower
$b^2$ values), the difference in power between the two statistics
decreases. For this type of variable, sampling from its associated
size-free correlation distribution implies minor differences in power
for both statistics.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/type2_def-1.pdf}
\caption{Power for both MHI and RV statistics as a function of the
chosen significance levels with respect to tests for variational
modularity applied on $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices with values sampled from
the distribution of correlations between local shape variables. Lines
are colored with respect to quantiles of the $b^2$ distribution,
according to the legend. \label{fig:type2_def}}
\end{figure}

For interlandmark distances (\autoref{fig:type2_ed}) there are
substantial differences on the relationship between power and
significance level if we consider the different parameters. First and
foremost, the effect of sampling from the size-free correlation
distribution in order to build $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices produces a
substantial decrease in power for either tests; however, this decrease
is more pronounced for tests based on the RV statistic, since for lower
effect sizes (high $b^2$ values) power approaches an identity
relationship with significance level. Sample size also interferes with
this relationship since increasing this quantity also increases power
when higher effect sizes (low $b^2$ values) are considered.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/type2_ed-1.pdf}
\caption{Power for both MHI and RV statistics as a function of the
chosen significance levels with respect to tests for variational
modularity applied on $\mathbf{C}_s$ correlation matrices with values

distances. Lines are colored with respect to quantiles of the $b^2$
distribution, according to the legend. The solid black line represents
the identity relationship. \label{fig:type2_ed}}
\end{figure}

With respect to Procrustes residuals (\autoref{fig:type2_sym}), tests
using either MHI or RV have reduced power regardless of effect or sample
size. Sampling from size-free correlation distributions to build
$\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices also has little effect. As for interlandmark
distances without size variation, power for tests performed using RV
values approaches an identity relationship with significance level;
increasing sample size has some effect, but it does not increase power
above 50\%.

to the legend. The solid black line represents the identity
relationship. \label{fig:type2_sym}}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Covariance matrices derived from morphological traits are supposed to
represent the pattern of co-dependence that arises due to a variety of
different interactions among developing morphological elements. Such
interactions are the expression of local developmental factors, as they
interact with the expression profiles of surrounding cell types,
producing coordinated changes in their cell cycles, thus integrating
resulting tissues in the adult population. Although these events of
local integration overlap, and the composed effect over adult covariance
patterns may produce a mixed signal (Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008;
Hallgrímsson et al. 2009), we believe that a careful comparison of
different yet equally proper ways of measuring and representing
organismal form may be informative of the underlying processes that
generate covariance patterns.

Due to the minimization of quadratic distances among homologous
landmarks during GPA, covariance matrices derived from Procrustes
estimators lose this signal of localized effects on covariance patterns
(Linde and Houle 2009); therefore, the use of such estimators to
investigate morphological integration or modularity implicitly imply in
a divorce between the phenomenom we would like to investigate and the
numerical representation we choose to use. This disconnection between
theory and measurement may have grave consequences for the hypotheses we
wish to test (Houle et al. 2011); such consequences are observable in
both our empirical tests and those tests performed on theoretical
matrices, as we explore below.

The mammalian Basicranium is composed of thirteen independent precursor
tissues originated from either paraxial mesoderm or neural crest; these
precursors from different origins may merge to form single bones, such
as the sphenoid (Jiang et al. 2002; Lieberman 2011). Furthermore, these
precursors ossify early in development, with a mosaic pattern composed
of both endochondral and intramembranous ossification, and, as the brain
grows in posterior developmental phases, it induces a pattern of
internal resorption and exterior deposition on the underlying posterior
Basicranium, (Lieberman et al. 2000); meanwhile, the anterior portion
suffers influence from the development of Facial elements (Bastir and
Rosas 2005). Thus, we might consider that since the Basicranium ossifies
early in development, the composed effect of all posterior steps of
cranial development will overshadow any pattern of integration this
region might have, as predicted by the palimpsest model of development
(Hallgrímsson et al. 2009). Moreover, the angulation between anterior
and posterior elements of the Basicranium has changed sensibly during
primate evolution, and such property appears to evolve in coordination
with Facial growth relative to the cranial Vault, in order to accomodate
both structures on each other (Scott 1958; Lieberman et al. 2000, 2008).

Due to this heterogeneity of developmental processes acting on the
Basicranium, we should not consider that the Basicranium is a
variational module, further expecting that a test of this property over
skull covariance patterns will fail to reject the null hypothesis of
random association for this region. However, considering the 42 tests we
performed over covariance matrices derived from Procrustes residuals
regarding localized hypotheses (left and right midpanels of
\autoref{fig:Func}a), the Basicranium is detected as a valid variational
module in 27 cases, distributed through matrices with size either
retained or removed; in some cases (e.g. \emph{Alouatta};
\emph{Cercopithecus}), the Basicranium is the only region detected.
Thus, Procrustes residuals show a pattern of detection of variational
modules that is the opposite of the expectation for this particular
test. In the set of matrices derived from interlandmark distances, the
Basicranium is not detected a single time; with local shape variables,
either with size variation retained or removed (remaining panels of
\autoref{fig:Func}a), the Basicranium is detected only three out of 42
times.

These two remaining types of representations, interlandmark distances
and local shape variables, show patterns of detection of variational
modules that are both consistent to the expectations derived from
developmental and functional interactions and to the particularities
that either type exhibits, especially when we consider how the different
components of size variation articulate with the observed patterns in
each type, both before and after we remove these components from
correlation patterns. Considering that interlandmark distances are on a
ratio scale, isometric variation will be represented to a greater extent
when compared to subtle allometric relationships, due to the
multiplicative nature of biological growth (Huxley 1932). Therefore, the
Oral trait set is detected as a valid variational module, considering
covariance matrices among interlandmark distances (upper left panel of
\autoref{fig:Func}a), since this region is strongly affected by the
induction of bone growth due to muscular activity beginning in the
pre-weaning period (Zelditch and Carmichael 1989; Hallgrímsson et al.
2009). Furthermore, in these matrices, allometric interactions are
associated with the strength of association between traits in Oral,
Nasal, Zygomatic and Vault regions in an evolutionary scale (Chapter 3);
thus, allometric relationships also play some role in the determination
of covariance/correlation patterns for other subregions, although such
pattern may be masked in interlandmark distances by the effect of
isometric variation. On the other hand, the patterns expressed in
covariance/correlation matrices for local shape variables are influenced
by allometric relationships defined on a proper scale (Jolicoeur 1963;
Houle et al. 2011; Márquez et al. 2012) and local developmental
processes. Thus, they may reflect this association between integration
and allometry.

By removing allometric effects from local shape variables (lower right
panel of \autoref{fig:Func}a), variational modularity can yet be
detected in both Oral and Nasal regions, while in a number of species,
the Vault region is no longer detected as a variational module. Vault
integration may be achieved through both allometric relationships and
the effect of relative brain growth, since Vault elements arise mostly
through intramembranous ossification, induced by the secretion of a
number of signaling factors from the outer brain membranous tissues,
with a modest but necessary contribution of mesoderm-derived tissue that
undergoes endochondral ossification (Jiang et al. 2002; Rice et al.
2003; Franz-Odendaal 2011; Lieberman 2011). Because the estimation of
local shape variables excludes shape variation associated with affine
transformations (Márquez et al. 2012), in those species that we cannot
detect variational modularity in the Vault after removing allometry, the
effect of relative brain growth may approximate such transformation.
This observation might hold if we consider that in humans, the growth of
Vault osteological elements occur, from a topological standpoint,
without deviations from an isometric growth model, forming regular
connections among bones (Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman 2014), since
the boundary of interactions between the tissue inducing growth (brain)
and the tissue whose growth is being induced (Vault bones) is also
regular. Thus, as this effect dominates the latter stages of pre-natal
development (Hallgrímsson and Lieberman 2008; Lieberman 2011), the
overall effect over skull growth patterns in this stage may mirror an
affine transformation, thus rendering it undetectable over covariance
patterns derived from local shape variables. In contrast, Oral and Nasal
elements have more complex patterns of connectivity arising from their
tight integration with the soft tissues that compose the remaining
elements of the Face (Lieberman 2011; Esteve-Altava et al. 2013;
Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman 2014), thus producing an intrincate
pattern of associations that may be responsible for the variational
modularity we are able to detect in all species, regardless of whether
size variation is retained or removed.

The differences among the pattern of detection in all representations
for local trait sets for RV values (\autoref{fig:Func}b) difficult the
interpretation of the results for this metric, as opposed to the results
regarding MHI values. It is noteworthy that the variance among species
with respect to RV values seem to indicate that RV values are sensitive
to the magnitude of morphological integration, as \emph{Papio} and
\emph{Macaca} are among the Catarrhines who display large values of this
quantity (Oliveira et al. 2009) and score higher (orange/red) RV values
for all local trait sets, at least when we consider interlandmark
distances. Such sensitivity might be one of the factors responsible for
the low power estimated for the RV metric using theoretical covariance
matrices; interestingly enough, this effect of magnitude of integration
(which is thought to emerge as a consequence of size variation; Wagner
1984; Marroig and Cheverud 2001, 2005; Porto et al. 2013) seems to also
affect Procrustes residuals regardless of whether covariance structure
arising from allometric relationships is removed or not.

However, for the set of hypotheses concerning differences between Facial
and Neurocranial traits (\autoref{fig:Dev}), there is substantial
agreement between tests performed using MI and RV values with respect to
the pattern of rejection of null hypotheses. For MI values
(\autoref{fig:Dev}a), the overall pattern of detection is similar to the
pattern detected in local trait sets, for all variable types; for RV
values (\autoref{fig:Dev}b), there is ample support for the hypotheses
that both Face and Neurocranium represent variational modules, in both
local shape variables and interlandmark distances. These regions have
marked differences in timing and pattern formation during development,
as observed from the behavior of their composing units (Zelditch and
Carmichael 1989; Hallgrímsson et al. 2009; Lieberman 2011; Esteve-Altava
and Rasskin-Gutman 2014); therefore, it is expected that the more
general pattern of distinction between Face and Neurocranium would be
detected regardless of the metric we choose to represent modularity.

\subsection{Theoretical Matrices and Error
Rates}\label{theoretical-matrices-and-error-rates}

The distribution of MI and RV values obtained from the theoretical
matrices we constructed (\autoref{fig:stat_dist_sim}) is a starting
point for understanding the differences in power for tests using these
two statistics (Figures \ref{fig:type2_def}--\ref{fig:type2_sym}). For
MI values, the distribution obtained from random ($\mathbf{C}_r$)
matrices is consistently the same, regardless of what representation we
used to sample correlations, or whether size was retained or removed. On
the other hand, the distribution of RV values for this kind of matrix
change depending on the representation sampled or whether size variation
has been removed or retained. Moreover, this change in behavior for the
distribution of RV values for $\mathbf{C}_r$ matrices implies in
different levels of overlap between these null distributions and the
distribution of values obtained for structured ($\mathbf{C}_s$)
matrices.

For Procrustes residuals, a substantial overlap occurs regardless of
whether size variation was removed or retained; unsurprisingly, our
estimates of power for RV in this type of representation are very low
(\autoref{fig:type2_sym}); nonetheless, power estimated for tests based
on Modularity Hypothesis Index is lower than in other types of
representation, since the difference between within-set and between-set
correlations in Procrustes residuals (\autoref{fig:cor_dist}) is the
lowest of all representations. A substantial overlap in RV distributions
for $\mathbf{C}_r$ and $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices also occurs with
interlandmark distances when size variation is removed, and it implies
low power for tests using RV values in this type of representation
(right column of \autoref{fig:type2_ed}). However, in this case there is
a substantial difference between within-set and between-set correlations
(\autoref{fig:cor_dist}), and tests using MI to represent modularity are
still able to detect such difference albeit with reduced power when
compared to tests over $\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices derived from
interlandmark distances with size retained (\autoref{fig:type2_ed}). In
those cases where both distributions for $\mathbf{C}_r$ and
$\mathbf{C}_s$ matrices do not overlap substantially --- for example,
when local shape variables are considered (\autoref{fig:type2_def}) ---
power for tests performed using MI values is always higher than for
tests using RV except when sample sizes are very high; in this case
power for both metrics approaches equality. The same behavior can also
be observed in interlandmark distances when size is retained (left
column of \autoref{fig:type2_ed}).

These results indicate that RV coefficents are more sensitive to the
absolute value of both within-set and between-set correlation
distributions than Modularity Hypothesis Indexes. For interlandmark
distances (\autoref{fig:type2_ed}), removing size variation reduced the
average value of both correlation distributions by a similar amount
(\autoref{fig:cor_dist}); the difference between average correlations in
these two sets actually increases, going from 0.042 to 0.061 when size
is removed. However, since the actual average correlations for these two
distributions approach zero, tests based on RV lose power more rapidly
than those tests based on MI. This sensitivity might be associated to
the use of squared covariances, as shown by Equation \ref{eq:rv}, while
Modularity Hypothesis Indexes use correlations on their natural scale
(Equation \ref{eq:mi}). Furthermore, as observed by Fruciano et al.
(2013), sample sizes sensibly influence the estimation of RV
coefficients, and we demostrate here that such sensitivity also extends
to estimates of power for tests using this statistic.

On the other hand, our estimates of power for tests using MI indicate
that this statistic is more robust to differences in absolute
correlation values or sample sizes, thus allowing comparisons across
more heterogeneous settings, such as our comparison between different
representations of form, with substantial variation in sample sizes. It
is noteworthy that the detection of variational modularity is akin to
Student's \emph{t} test, since we are trying to determine whether two
groups of observations (correlations between traits in the same subset
\emph{versus} correlations between traits in different subsets) have a
significant difference in average values; we use resampling procedures
to estimate significance in this case only due to the interdependency
between pairwise correlations. Thus, as Modularity Hypothesis Indexes
are estimated with a formula that is very similar to that of a \emph{t}
statistic (difference between location parameters for two groups,
divided by a scale parameter --- ICV), we believe that this statistic is
a proper way to represent variational modularity; the robustness of the
tests using this statistic reinforce this belief.

Our approach to construct theoretical matrices attempts to simulate the
most simple situation in detecting variational modularity, that is, the
situation where there are only two subsets of traits; this situation is
akin to the distinction between Face and Neurocranium in our empirical
dataset (\autoref{fig:Dev}). This simplified setting may be the reason
why the estimation of Type I error rates (\autoref{fig:type1}) indicates
no difference among representations of form or statistic used to
represent modularity. In a simple setting such as this, both statistics
are capable of detecting the distinction between Face and Neurocranium,
expect when both are used on covariance/correlation patterns derived
from Procrustes residuals. In that case the issues regarding Procrustes
estimators difficult the detection of modularity patterns even in the
most simple situation; even though we built theoretical matrices using
correlations sampled from these estimators, actually simulating the
interference in covariance structure that such estimators produce in our
theoretical matrices is quite difficult.

The issues we found with both the use of Procrustes estimators for
covariance matrices and the use of RV coefficients to estimate and
detect variational modularity may explain results found by other authors
regarding the detection of modular patterns; for instance,
Martínez-Abadías et al. (2011) has found no evidence indicating that
either genetic or phenotypic covariance structure for human skulls
conforms to a modular structure, since all tests performed by these
authors failed to reject the null hypothesis of random association.
These authors use Procrustes estimators to represent covariance
structure, and test their hypothesis of partitioning (Face, Vault and
Base) using RV as the statistic representing variational modularity.
Thus, as this combination implies in very low power
(\autoref{fig:type2_sym}), not rejecting the null hypothesis in their
case might be a consequence of the chosen estimates of both covariance
structure and variational modularity. Moreover, a failure in rejecting
null hypotheses implies that the partitioning the authors propose cannot
be differentiated from a random association without meaningful
relationships; however, the authors argue that this is an evidence that
the human skull is highly integrated.

The approach we explore in the present work is but one of the different
manners one can investigate the association between genetic, functional
and developmental interactions and correlation structure (Mitteroecker
and Bookstein 2007). For example, Perez et al. (2009) relies on
abstracting correlation matrices into networks, further using
community-detection algorithms to search for modular patterns without
\emph{a priori} hypotheses, associating their results with knockout
experiments that support the communities they found among traits;
however, to what extent correlation matrices are actually well
represented in this manner remains an open question. Furthermore, the
authors use Procrustes estimators, which may bias the detection of
modularity patterns in this setting in the same manner as we
demonstrated here.

Monteiro et al. (2005) assumes that the underlying morphogenetic
components of the rodent mandible behave as modules, further
investigating the patters of correlation between these units in both
within-species variation and between-species variation among Echimids;
Monteiro and Nogueira (2010), relying on the correspondence of these
units through mammalian diversification did the same to phylostomid
bats. Although using a landmark-based approach to represent
morphological variation, the authors do not use Procrustes estimators to
represent covariance structure among these units, and the pattern of
reorganization of correlation structure among these units associated
with niche diversification in phylostomids seems robust, considering
that this radiation may have been associated with a very heterogeneous
adaptive landscape, and such heterogeneity may lead to a reorganization
of correlation patterns (Jones 2007; Jones et al. 2012; Melo and Marroig
2015).

Another valid approach is to model certain aspects of development as
null hypotheses; Esteve-Altava and Rasskin-Gutman (2014), when
investigating the pattern of connections among human cranial bones,
conceived the null hypothesis that unconstrained bone growth is
sufficient to explain the observed patterns. Such approach could be
extended to investigate morphological covariance structure; if we
consider the geometric properties of the features we measure
(Mitteroecker and Bookstein 2007), one could formulate the null
hypothesis that topological proximity is a sufficient explanation for
the observed covariance structure, against the alternative hypothesis
that local developmental processes coupled with functional interactions
produce stronger relationships among close elements that surpass these
purely topological interactions. Alternatively, one could actively look
for variational boundaries between regions, as boundary formation is a
phenomenom that has been well studied under a dynamical perspective on
development (e.g. Turing 1952; Meinhardt 1983; Tiedemann et al. 2012).

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Considering the issues we explored here regarding the use of Procrustes
estimators for covariance or correlation matrices and the use of RV to
measure modular relationships among traits, the approaches we explored
here are simple from an operational standpoint. Almost certainly
modularity patterns are not expressed in phenotypic data as the binary
hypotheses we used here (Hallgrímsson et al. 2009); however, such
hypotheses must be interpreted in the light of developmental dynamics.
Either interlandmark distances and local shape variables seem valid
options to represent morphological variation, if their limitations are
taken into consideration; such statement is valid to any type of
representation of form one can devise. Moreover, the measurements we
make and the parameters we estimate from them have to be properly
connected to the models we are considering; otherwise, inferences made
from such models may be devoid of meaning (Wagner 2010; Houle et al.
2011).
