	abstract = {Recent paleoanthropological discoveries reveal a diverse, potentially speciose human fossil record. Such extensive morphological diversity results from the action of divergent evolutionary forces on an evolving lineage. Here, we apply quantitative evolutionary theory to test whether random evolutionary processes alone can explain the morphological diversity seen among fossil australopith and early Homo crania from the Plio-Pleistocene. We show that although selection may have played an important role in diversifying hominin facial morphology in the late Pliocene, this is not the case during the early evolution of the genus Homo, where genetic drift was probably the primary force responsible for facial diversification.},

The stability and evolution of this matrix are important issues because they affect our ability to predict how the phenotypic traits evolve by selection and drift. Despite the centrality of these issues, comparative, experimental, and analytical approaches to understanding the stability and evolution of the G-matrix have met with limited success. Nevertheless, empirical studies often find that certain structural features of the matrix are remarkably constant, suggesting that persistent selection regimes or other factors promote stability. On the theoretical side, no one has been able to derive equations that would relate stability of the G-matrix to selection regimes, population size, migration, or to the details of genetic architecture. Recent simulation studies of evolving G-matrices offer solutions to some of these problems, as well as a deeper, synthetic understanding of both the G-matrix and adaptive radiations.},

	abstract = {Guenons are the most diverse clade of African monkeys. They have varied ecologies, include arboreal and terrestrial species, and can be found in nearly every region of sub-Saharan Africa. Species boundaries are often uncertain, with a variable number of species and subspecies mostly recognised on the basis of their geographic distribution and pelage. If guenon soft tissue patterns show high variability, the same does not seem to hold for skull morphology. Guenon skulls are traditionally considered relatively undifferentiated and homogeneous. However, patterns of variation in skulls have never been examined using a large number of specimens sampled across the breadth of species diversity. Thus, in the present study, skulls of adult guenons and two outgroup species are analysed using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics. Three-dimensional coordinates of 86 anatomical landmarks were measured on 1,315 adult specimens belonging to all living guenon species except Cercopithecus dryas. Species are well-discriminated using shape but the best discrimination occurs when species have either a long evolutionary history (e.g., Allenopithecus nigroviridis) or represent extremes of size variation (Miopithecus sp. and Erythrocebus patas). Interspecific phenetic relationships reflect size differences. Four main clusters are found that mainly correspond to four size groups: the smallest species (Miopithecus sp.), the largest species (E. patas plus the study outgroups), a group of medium-small arboreal guenons, and a group of medium-large arboreal and terrestrial guenons. Correlations between interspecific shape distances and interspecific differences in size are higher than between shape distances and genetic distances. However, if only the component of interspecific shape variation which is not correlated to evolutionary allometry is used in the comparison with genetic distances, correlations are up to 1.4 times larger than those including allometric shape. The smallest correlations are those between shape and ecological distances, which is consistent with the lack of clusters clearly reflecting broad ecological specialisations (e.g., arboreality versus terrestriality). Thus, size, which is generally considered more evolutionarily labile than shape, seems to have played a major role in the evolution of the guenons. The incongruence between interspecific shape differences and phylogeny might be explained by a large proportion of shape changes having occurred along allometric trajectories that tend to be conserved within this clade.},

	abstract = {Theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the G-matrix, which summarizes additive genetic variances and covariances of quantitative traits, changes over time. Such evolution and fluctuation of the G-matrix could potentially have wide-ranging effects on phenotypic evolution. Nevertheless, no studies have yet addressed G-matrix stability and evolution when movement of an intermediate optimum includes large, episodic jumps or stochasticity. Here, we investigate such scenarios by using simulation-based models of G-matrix evolution. These analyses yield four important insights regarding the evolution and stability of the G-matrix. (i) Regardless of the model of peak movement, a moving optimum causes the G-matrix to orient towards the direction of net peak movement, so that genetic variance is enhanced in that direction (the variance enhancement effect). (ii) Peak movement skews the distribution of breeding values in the direction of movement, which impedes the response to selection. (iii) The stability of the G-matrix is affected by the overall magnitude and direction of peak movement, but modes and rates of peak movement have surprisingly small effects (the invariance principle). (iv) Both episodic and stochastic peak movement increase the probability that a population will fall below its carrying capacity and go extinct. We also present novel equations for the response of the trait mean to multivariate selection, which take into account the higher moments of the distribution of breeding values.},

	volume = {7},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-7-20},
	abstract = {Background How are morphological evolution and developmental changes related? This rather old and intriguing question had a substantial boost after the 70s within the framework of heterochrony (changes in rates or timing of development) and nowadays has the potential to make another major leap forward through the combination of approaches: molecular biology, developmental experimentation, comparative systematic studies, geometric morphometrics and quantitative genetics. Here I take an integrated approach combining life-history comparative analyses, classical and geometric morphometrics applied to ontogenetic series to understand changes in size and shape which happen during the evolution of two New World Monkeys (NWM) sister genera. Results Cebus and Saimiri share the same basic allometric patterns in skull traits, a result robust to sexual and ontogenetic variation. If adults of both genera are compared in the same scale (discounting size differences) most differences are small and not statistically significant. These results are consistent using both approaches, classical and geometric Morphometrics. Cebus is a genus characterized by a number of peramorphic traits (adult-like) while Saimiri is a genus with paedomorphic (child like) traits. Yet, the whole clade Cebinae is characterized by a unique combination of very high pre-natal growth rates and relatively slow post-natal growth rates when compared to the rest of the NWM. Morphologically Cebinae can be considered paedomorphic in relation to the other NWM. Geometric morphometrics allows the precise separation of absolute size, shape variation associated with size (allometry), and shape variation non-associated with size. Interestingly, and despite the fact that they were extracted as independent factors (principal components), evolutionary allometry (those differences in allometric shape associated with intergeneric differences) and ontogenetic allometry (differences in allometric shape associated with ontogenetic variation within genus) are correlated within these two genera. Furthermore, morphological differences produced along these two axes are quite similar. Cebus and Saimiri are aligned along the same evolutionary allometry and have parallel ontogenetic allometry trajectories. Conclusion The evolution of these two Platyrrhini monkeys is basically due to a size differentiation (and consequently to shape changes associated with size). Many life-history changes are correlated or may be the causal agents in such evolution, such as delayed on-set of reproduction in Cebus and larger neonates in Saimiri.},

Primatol. 12:387-468) is consistent with quantitative differences in saki morphology. Discriminant analyses on 39 skull traits show that Pithecia species and subspecies are well-differentiated. Morphological distances (D2) among sakis clearly show the morphological unity of the pithecia-chrysocephala (Pithecia) and irrorata-vanzolinii-monacha (Monacha) species groups. The Pithecia species group is distributed north of the Amazon and has a smaller cranium than the Monacha group, distributed south of that river. Despite the size difference, multivariate static allometric patterns among sakis are quite similar. After removing size and allometric changes in shape from the data, species and subspecies are still differentiated, although to a lesser extent. D2 distances obtained from these scale-corrected data are similar in magnitude and pattern to the original D2, but show a closer similarity of P. monacha with the Pithecia group.

	abstract = {Similarity of genetic and phenotypic variation patterns among populations is important for making quantitative inferences about past evolutionary forces acting to differentiate populations and for evaluating the evolution of relationships among traits in response to new functional and developmental relationships. Here, phenotypic co variance and correlation structure is compared among Platyrrhine Neotropical primates. Comparisons range from among species within a genus to the superfamily level. Matrix correlation followed by Mantel’s test and vector correlation among responses to random natural selection vectors (random skewers) were used to compare correlation and variance/covariance matrices of 39 skull traits. Sampling errors involved in matrix estimates were taken into account in comparisons using matrix repeatability to set upper limits for each pairwise comparison. Results indicate that covariance structure is not strictly constant but that the amount of variance pattern divergence observed among taxa is generally low and not associated with taxonomic distance. Specific instances of divergence are identified. There is no correlation between the amount of divergence in covariance patterns among the 16 genera and their phylogenetic distance derived from a conjoint analysis of four already published nuclear gene datasets. In contrast, there is a significant correlation between phylogenetic distance and morphological distance (Mahalanobis distance among genus centroids). This result indicates that while the phenotypic means were evolving during the last 30 millions years of New World monkey evolution, phenotypic covariance structures of Neotropical primate skulls have remained relatively consistent. Neotropical primates can be divided into four major groups based on their feeding habits (fruit-leaves, seed-fruits, insect-fruits, and gum-insect-fruits). Differences in phenotypic covariance structure are correlated with differences in feeding habits, indicating that to some extent changes in interrelationships among skull traits are associated with changes in feeding habits. Finally, common patterns and levels of morphological integration are found among Platyrrhine primates, suggesting that functional/developmental integration could be one major factor keeping covariance structure relatively stable during evolutionary diversification of South American monkeys.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary change in New World Monkey (NWM) skulls occurred primarily along the line of least resistance defined by size (including allometric) variation (g(max)). Although the direction of evolution was aligned with this axis, it was not clear whether this macroevolutionary pattern results from the conservation of within population genetic covariance patterns (long-term constraint) or long-term selection along a size dimension, or whether both, constraints and selection, were inextricably involved. Furthermore, G-matrix stability can also be a consequence of selection, which implies that both, constraints embodied in g(max) and evolutionary changes observed on the trait averages, would be influenced by selection. Here, we describe a combination of approaches that allows one to test whether any particular instance of size evolution is a correlated by-product due to constraints (g(max)) or is due to direct selection on size and apply it to NWM lineages as a case study. The approach is based on comparing the direction and amount of evolutionary change produced by two different simulated sets of net-selection gradients (beta), a size (isometric and allometric size) and a nonsize set. Using this approach it is possible to distinguish between the two hypotheses (indirect size evolution due to constraints or direct selection on size), because although both may produce an evolutionary response aligned with g(max), the amount of change produced by random selection operating through the variance/covariance patterns (constraints hypothesis) will be much smaller than that produced by selection on size (selection hypothesis). Furthermore, the alignment of simulated evolutionary changes with g(max) when selection is not on size is not as tight as when selection is actually on size, allowing a statistical test of whether a particular observed case of evolution along the line of least resistance is the result of selection along it or not. Also, with matrix diagonalization (principal components [PC]) it is possible to calculate directly the net-selection gradient on size alone (first PC [PC1]) by dividing the amount of phenotypic difference between any two populations by the amount of variation in PC1, which allows one to benchmark whether selection was on size or not.},

Factors or processes affecting morphology only locally may respond to selection more easily than common factors that may lead to deleterious side effects and hence are expected to be more conserved. We briefly review evidence for such global factors in primate cranial development as well as for local factors constrained to either the face or the neurocranium. In a sample comprising 157 crania of Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, and Gorilla gorilla, we statistically estimated common and local factors of shape variation from Procrustes coordinates of 347 landmarks and semilandmarks. Common factors with pleiotropic effects on both the face and the neurocranium account for a large amount of shape variation, but mainly by extension or truncation of otherwise conserved developmental pathways. Local factors (modular shape characteristics) have more degrees of freedom for evolutionary change than mere ontogenetic scaling. Cranial shape is similarly integrated during development in all three species, but human evolution involves dissociation among several characteristics. The dissociation has probably been achieved by evolutionary alterations and by the novel emergence of local factors affecting characteristics that are controlled at the same time by the common factors.},

	abstract = {The study of the genetic variance/covariance matrix (G-matrix) is a recent and fruitful approach in evolutionary biology, providing a window of investigating for the evolution of complex characters. Although G-matrix studies were originally conducted for microevolutionary timescales, they could be extrapolated to macroevolution as long as the G-matrix remains relatively constant, or proportional, along the period of interest. A promising approach to investigating the constancy of G-matrices is to compare their phenotypic counterparts (P-matrices) in a large group of related species; if significant similarity is found among several taxa, it is very likely that the underlying G-matrices are also equivalent. Here we study the similarity of covariance and correlation structure in a broad sample of Old World monkeys and apes (Catarrhini). We made phylogenetically structured comparisons of correlation and covariance matrices derived from 39 skull traits, ranging from between species to the superfamily level. We also compared the overall magnitude of integration between skull traits (r2) for all Catarrhini genera. Our results show that P-matrices were not strictly constant among catarrhines, but the amount of divergence observed among taxa was generally low. There was significant and positive correlation between the amount of divergence in correlation and covariance patterns among the 30 genera and their phylogenetic distances derived from a recently proposed phylogenetic hypothesis. Our data demonstrate that the P-matrices remained relatively similar along the evolutionary history of catarrhines, and comparisons with the G-matrix available for a New World monkey genus (Saguinus) suggests that the same holds for all anthropoids. The magnitude of integration, in contrast, varied considerably among genera, indicating that evolution of the magnitude, rather than the pattern of inter-trait correlations, might have played an important role in the diversification of the catarrhine skull.},

	abstract = {The genotype-phenotype (GP) map consists of developmental and physiological mechanisms mapping genetic onto phenotypic variation. It determines the distribution of heritable phenotypic variance on which selection can act. Comparative studies of morphology as well as of gene regulatory networks show that the GP map itself evolves, yet little is known about the actual evolutionary mechanisms involved. The study of such mechanisms requires exploring the variation in GP maps at the population level, which presently is easier to quantify by statistical genetic methods rather than by regulatory network structures. We focus on the evolution of pleiotropy, a major structural aspect of the GP map. Pleiotropic genes affect multiple traits and underlie genetic covariance between traits, often causing evolutionary constraints. Previous quantitative genetic studies have demonstrated population-level variation in pleiotropy in the form of loci, at which genotypes differ in the genetic covariation between traits. This variation can potentially fuel evolution of the GP map under selection and/or drift. Here, we propose a developmental mechanism underlying population genetic variation in covariance and test its predictions. Specifically, the mechanism predicts that the loci identified as responsible for genetic variation in pleiotropy are involved in trait-specific epistatic interactions. We test this prediction for loci affecting allometric relationships between traits in an advanced intercross between inbred mouse strains. The results consistently support the prediction. We further find a high degree of sign epistasis in these interactions, which we interpret as an indication of adaptive gene complexes within the diverged parental lines.},

Understanding the relationship between these two types of allometry is crucial to understanding the evolution of allometry and, more generally, the evolution of shape. However, the effects of ontogenetic allometry on static allometry remain largely unexplored. Here, we first show analytically how individual variation in ontogenetic allometry and body size affect static allometry. Using two longitudinal data sets on ontogenetic and static allometry, we then estimate variances and covariances for the different parameters of the ontogenetic allometry defined in our model and assess their relative contribution to the static allometric slope. The mean ontogenetic allometry is the main parameter that determines the static allometric slope, while the covariance between the ontogenetic allometric slope and body size generates most of the discrepancies between ontogenetic and static allometry. These results suggest that the apparent evolutionary stasis of the static allometric slope is not generated by internal (developmental) constraints but more likely results from external constraints imposed by selection.},

	abstract = {The form of an organism is the combination of its size and its shape. For a sample of forms, biologists wish to characterize both mean form and the variation in form. For geometric data, where form is characterized as the spatial locations of homologous points, the first step in analysis superimposes the forms, which requires an assumption about what measure of size is appropriate. Geometric morphometrics adopts centroid size as the natural measure of size, and assumes that variation around the mean form is isometric with size. These assumptions limit the interpretation of the resulting estimates of mean and variance in form. We illustrate these problems using allometric variation in shape. We show that superimposition based on subsets of relatively isometric points can yield superior inferences about the overall pattern of variation. We propose and demonstrate two superimposition techniques based on this idea. In subset superimposition, landmarks are progressively discarded from the data used for superimposition if they result in significant decreases in the variation among the remaining landmarks. In outline superimposition, regularly distributed pseudolandmarks on the continuous outline of a form are used as the basis for superimposition of the landmarks contained within it. Simulations show that these techniques can result in dramatic improvements in the accuracy of estimated variance-covariance matrices among landmarks when our assumptions are roughly satisfied. The pattern of variation inferred by means of our superimposition techniques can be quite different from that recovered from full generalized Procrustes superimposition. The pattern of shape variation in the wings of drosophilid flies appears to meet these assumptions. Adoption of superimposition procedures that incorporate biological assumptions about the nature of size and of the variation in shape can dramatically improve the ability to infer the pattern of variation in geometric morphometric data.},

	abstract = {An organism is built through a series of contingent factors, yet it is determined by historical, physical, and developmental constraints. A constraint should not be understood as an absolute obstacle to evolution, as it may also generate new possibilities for evolutionary change. Modularity is, in this context, an important way of organizing biological information and has been recognized as a central concept in evolutionary biology bridging on developmental, genetics, morphological, biochemical, and physiological studies. In this article, we explore how modularity affects the evolution of a complex system in two mammalian lineages by analyzing correlation, variance/covariance, and residual matrices (without size variation). We use the multivariate response to selection equation to simulate the behavior of Eutheria and Metharia skulls in terms of their evolutionary flexibility and constraints. We relate these results to classical approaches based on morphological integration tests based on functional/developmental hypotheses. Eutherians (Neotropical primates) showed smaller magnitudes of integration compared with Metatheria (didelphids) and also skull modules more clearly delimited. Didelphids showed higher magnitudes of integration and their modularity is strongly influenced by within-groups size variation to a degree that evolutionary responses are basically aligned with size variation. Primates still have a good portion of the total variation based on size; however, their enhanced modularization allows a broader spectrum of responses, more similar to the selection gradients applied (enhanced flexibility). Without size variation, both groups become much more similar in terms of modularity patterns and magnitudes and, consequently, in their evolutionary flexibility. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

	abstract = {Development introduces structured correlations among traits that may constrain or bias the distribution of phenotypes produced. Moreover, when suitable heritable variation exists, natural selection may alter such constraints and correlations, affecting the phenotypic variation available to subsequent selection. However, exactly how the distribution of phenotypes produced by complex developmental systems can be shaped by past selective environments is poorly understood. Here we investigate the evolution of a network of recurrent non-linear ontogenetic interactions, such as a gene regulation network, in various selective scenarios. We find that evolved networks of this type can exhibit several phenomena that are familiar in cognitive learning systems. These include formation of a distributed associative memory that can ‘store’ and ‘recall’ multiple phenotypes that have been selected in the past, recreate complete adult phenotypic patterns accurately from partial or corrupted embryonic phenotypes, and ‘generalise’ (by exploiting evolved developmental modules) to produce new combinations of phenotypic features. We show that these surprising behaviours follow from an equivalence between the action of natural selection on phenotypic correlations and associative learning, well-understood in the context of neural networks. This helps to explain how development facilitates the evolution of high-fitness phenotypes and how this ability changes over evolutionary time.This article is protected by copyright.

Consequently, many of the new and planned developments in comparative analysis already have well-tested solutions in quantitative genetics. In this paper, we take three recent publications that develop phylogenetic meta-analysis, either implicitly or explicitly, and show how they can be considered as quantitative genetic models. We highlight some of the difficulties with the proposed solutions, and demonstrate that standard quantitative genetic theory and software offer solutions. We also show how results from Bayesian quantitative genetics can be used to create efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for phylogenetic mixed models, thereby extending their generality to non-Gaussian data. Of particular utility is the development of multinomial models for analysing the evolution of discrete traits, and the development of multi-trait models in which traits can follow different distributions. Meta-analyses often include a nonrandom collection of species for which the full phylogenetic tree has only been partly resolved. Using missing data theory, we show how the presented models can be used to correct for nonrandom sampling and show how taxonomies and phylogenies can be combined to give a flexible framework with which to model dependence.},

	abstract = {The mammalian mandible is a developmentally modular but functionally integrated system. Whether morphological integration can evolve to match the optimal pattern of functional integration may depend on the developmental origin of integration, specifically, on the role that direct epigenetic interactions play in shaping integration. These interactions are hypothesized to integrate modules and also to be highly conservative, potentially constraining the evolution of integration. Using the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) mandible as a model system, we test five a priori developmental hypotheses that predict mandibular integration and we also explore for correlations between shapes of mandibular regions not anticipated by any of the developmental models. To determine whether direct epigenetic interactions are highly conserved in rodents, we examine the correlation structure of fluctuating asymmetry, and compare integration patterns between fox squirrels and prairie deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii). In fox squirrels, we find a correlation structure unanticipated by all a priori developmental models: adjacent parts along the proximodistal jaw axis are correlated whereas more distant ones are not. The most notable exception is that the shape of the anterior incisor alveolus is correlated with the shape of the ramus (FA component) or coronoid (symmetric component). Those exceptions differ between species; in prairie deer mice, the molar alveolus is connected to more parts, and the incisor alveolus to fewer, than in fox squirrels. The structure of integration suggests that the mandible cannot be decomposed into parts but rather is a single connected unit, a result consistent with its functional integration. That match between functional and developmental integration may arise, at least in part, from function-induced growth, building developmental integration into the functional system and enabling direct epigenetic interactions to evolve when function does.},

	abstract = {Morphological allometry refers to patterns of covariance between body parts resulting from variation in body size. Whether measured during growth (ontogenetic allometry), among individuals at similar developmental stage (static allometry), or among populations or species (evolutionary allometry), allometric relationships are often tight and relatively invariant. Consequently, it has been suggested that allometries have low evolvability and could constrain phenotypic evolution by forcing evolving species along fixed trajectories. Alternatively, allometric relationships may result from natural selection for functional optimization. Despite nearly a century of active research, distinguishing between these alternatives remains difficult, partly due to wide differences in the meaning assigned to the term allometry. In particular, a broad use of the term, encompassing any monotonic relationship between body parts, has become common. This usage breaks the connection to the proportional growth regulation that motivated Huxley's original narrow-sense use of allometry to refer to power–law relationships between traits. Focusing on the narrow-sense definition of allometry, we review here evidence for and against the allometry-as-a-constraint hypothesis. Although the low evolvability and the evolutionary invariance of the static allometric slope observed in some studies suggest a possible constraining effect of this parameter on phenotypic evolution, the lack of knowledge about selection on allometry prevents firm conclusions.},

Changes in the timing of facial growth have been invoked as a mechanism for the origin of our short human face from our long-faced extinct relatives. Such heterochronic changes arguably permit great evolutionary flexibility, allowing the mammalian face to be remodelled simply by modifying postnatal growth. Here we present new data that show that this mechanism is significantly constrained by adult size. Small mammals are more brachycephalic (short faced) than large ones, despite the putative independence between adult size and facial length. This pattern holds across four phenotypic lineages: antelopes, fruit bats, tree squirrels and mongooses. Despite the apparent flexibility of facial heterochrony, growth of the face is linked to absolute size and introduces what seems to be a loose but clade-wide mammalian constraint on head shape.},

	abstract = {No human foragers have been recorded as living without cooking, and people who choose a ‘raw-foodist’ life-style experience low energy and impaired reproductive function. This suggests that cooking may be obligatory for humans. The possibility that cooking is obligatory is supported by calculations suggesting that a diet of raw food could not supply sufficient calories for a normal hunter–gatherer lifestyle. In particular, many plant foods are too fiber-rich when raw, while most raw meat appears too tough to allow easy chewing. If cooking is indeed obligatory for humans but not for other apes, this means that human biology must have adapted to the ingestion of cooked food (i.e. food that is tender and low in fiber) in ways that no longer allow efficient processing of raw foods. Cooking has been practiced for ample time to allow the evolution of such adaptations. Digestive adaptations have not been investigated in detail but may include small teeth, small hind-guts, large small intestines, a fast gut passage rate, and possibly reduced ability to detoxify. The adoption of cooking can also be expected to have had far-reaching effects on such aspects of human biology as life-history, social behavior, and evolutionary psychology. Since dietary adaptations are central to understanding species evolution, cooking appears to have been a key feature of the environment of human evolutionary adaptedness. Further investigation is therefore needed of the ways in which human digestive physiology is constrained by the need for food of relatively high caloric density compared to other great apes.},

Fortunately it is sometimes granted to one single man in his lifetime to acquire the encyclopaedic knowledge of facts, and to possess the scientific insight and skill necessary to detect the unifying principles controlling the apparently most diverse phenomena.

This new edition of his book is a mine of information, but, more than that, through it all, as a golden thread, runs mathematical skill applied, not as is usual to physics and chemistry, but to biology.
It is necessary to read the entire book to realize how fruitful such application can be. Nevertheless, every biologist ought to dip into this book and read the sections dealing with his own special interests.

In this review, I show that this idea is contradicted by empirical evidence and theory. Although positive allometry is a typical attribute of some sexual traits in certain groups, the preponderance of positively allometric sexual traits in the empirical literature apparently results from a sampling bias reflecting a fascination with unusually exaggerated (bizarre) traits. I review empirical examples from a broad range of taxa illustrating the diversity of allometric patterns exhibited by signal, weapon, clasping and genital traits, as well as nonsexual traits. This evidence suggests that positive allometry may be the exception rather than the rule in sexual traits, that directional sexual selection does not necessarily lead to the evolution of positive allometry and, conversely, that positive allometry is not necessarily a consequence of sexual selection, and that many sexual traits exhibit sex differences in allometric intercept rather than slope. Such diversity in the allometries of secondary sexual traits is to be expected, given that optimal allometry should reflect resource allocation trade-offs, and patterns of sexual and viability selection on both trait size and body size. An unbiased empirical assessment of the relation between sexual selection and allometry is an essential step towards an understanding of this diversity.},

	abstract = {Hominin fossils of gracile and robust australopith groups were found both in East and in South Africa. It is unclear, however, whether all robusts belong to a monophyletic Paranthropus clade, as the craniofacial resemblance among robust australopiths might only be a superficial correlate of similar masticatory adaptations and not evidence of shared ancestry. It has been suggested that the East African Australopithecus/Paranthropus boisei and the South African A./P. robustus might be convergent allometric variants of their gracile geographical neighbors A. afarensis and A. africanus. Here we approach the phylogenetic questions about robust and gracile australopiths from an “evo-devo” perspective, examining how simple alterations of development could contribute to the shape differences among hominin species. Using geometric morphometrics we compare gracile and robust australopith crania in the context of the allometric scaling patterns of Pan troglodytes, P. paniscus, and Gorilla gorilla. We examine support for two alternative evolutionary scenarios based on predictions derived from quantitative genetics models: either (1) A./P. robustus evolved in South Africa from the gracile A. africanus, or (2) A./P. robustus is a local variant of the eastern African A./P. boisei. We use developmental simulations to demonstrate that some robust characteristics (wide faces, anteriorly placed zygomatics, and facial dishing) can be predicted by allometric scaling along the ontogenetic trajectory of the gracile A. africanus. We find, however, that the facial differences between A. africanus specimens (Taung, Sts 5, Sts 71, and Stw 505) and A./P. robustus specimen SK 48 cannot be explained by allometric scaling alone. Facial shape differences between A./P. robustus SK 48 and A./P. boisei (KNM-ER 732, KNM-ER 406, OH 5) and the A./P. aethiopicus specimen KNM-WT 17000, on the other hand, can largely be explained by allometric scaling.

Equilibrium formulas for large, randomly mating populations demonstrate that, when selection on polygenic variation is much smaller than twice the harmonic mean recombination rate between loci with interacting fitnesses, linkage disequilibrium is negligible and pleiotropy is the main cause of genetic correlations between characters. Under these conditions, approximate expressions of or the dynamics of the genetic covariances due to pleiotropic mutations are obtained. Patterns of genetic covariance between characters and their evolution are discussed with reference to data on polygenic mutation, chromosomal organization and morphological integration.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies suggest that the transition from Australopithecus to Homo was characterized by evolutionary innovation, resulting in the emergence and coexistence of a diversity of forms. However, the evolutionary processes necessary to drive such a transition have not been examined. Here, we apply statistical tests developed from quantitative evolutionary theory to assess whether morphological differences among late australopith and early Homo species in Africa have been shaped by natural selection. Where selection is demonstrated, we identify aspects of morphology that were most likely under selective pressure, and determine the nature (type, rate) of that selection. Results demonstrate that selection must be invoked to explain an Au. africanus—Au. sediba—Homo transition, while transitions from late australopiths to various early Homo species that exclude Au. sediba can be achieved through drift alone. Rate tests indicate that selection is largely directional, acting to rapidly differentiate these taxa. Reconstructions of patterns of directional selection needed to drive the Au. africanus—Au. sediba—Homo transition suggest that selection would have affected all regions of the skull. These results may indicate that an evolutionary path to Homo without Au. sediba is the simpler path and/or provide evidence that this pathway involved more reliance on cultural adaptations to cope with environmental change.},

	abstract = {Julian Huxley showed that within-species (static) allometric (power-law) relations can arise from proportional growth regulation with the exponent in the power law equaling the factor of proportionality. Allometric exponents may therefore be hard to change and act as constraints on the independent evolution of traits. In apparent contradiction to this, many empirical studies have concluded that static allometries are evolvable. Many of these studies have been based, however, on a broad definition of allometry that includes any monotonic shape change with size, and do not falsify the hypothesis of constrained narrow-sense allometry. Here, we present the first phylogenetic comparative study of narrow-sense allometric exponents based on a reanalysis of data on eye span and body size in stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae). Consistent with a role in sexual selection, we found strong evidence that male slopes were tracking “optima” based on sexual dimorphism and relative male trait size. This tracking was slow, however, with estimated times of 2–3 million years for adaptation to exceed ancestral influence on the trait. Our results are therefore consistent with adaptive evolution on million-year time scales, but cannot rule out that static allometry may act as a constraint on eye-span adaptation at shorter time scales.},

Logarithmic transformation of tooth crown area and body weight yields a linear model of slope 0.67 as an isometric (geometric) baseline for study of dental allometry. This model is compared with that predicted by metabolic scaling (slope = 0.75). Tarsius and other insectivores have larger teeth for their body size than generalized primates do, and they are not included in this analysis. Among generalized primates, tooth size is highly correlated with body size. Correlations of upper and lower cheek teeth with body size range from 0.90–0.97, depending on tooth position. Central cheek teeth (P 44 and M 11) have allometric coefficients ranging from 0.57–0.65, falling well below geometric scaling. Anterior and posterior cheek teeth scale at or above metabolic scaling. Considered individually or as a group, upper cheek teeth scale allometrically with lower coefficients than corresponding lower cheek teeth; the reverse is true for incisors. The sum of crown areas for all upper cheek teeth scales significantly below geometric scaling, while the sum of crown areas for all lower cheek teeth approximates geometric scaling. Tooth size can be used to predict the body weight of generalized fossil primates. This is illustrated for Aegyptopithecus and other Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene primates. Regressions based on tooth size in generalized primates yield reasonable estimates of body weight, but much remains to be learned about tooth size and body size scaling in more restricted systematic groups and dietary guilds.},

Both terms have complex histories with respect to both conceptualization and quantification, resulting in a plethora of integration indices in use. We review briefly the divergent definitions, uses and measures of integration and modularity and make conceptual links to allometry. We also discuss how integration and modularity might evolve. Although integration is generally thought to be generated and maintained by correlational selection, theoretical considerations suggest the relationship is not straightforward. We caution here against uncontrolled comparisons of indices across studies. In the absence of controls for trait number, dimensionality, homology, development and function, it is difficult, or even impossible, to compare integration indices across organisms or traits. We suggest that care be invested in relating measurement to underlying theory or hypotheses, and that summative, theory-free descriptors of integration generally be avoided. The papers that follow in this Theme Issue illustrate the diversity of approaches to studying integration and modularity, highlighting strengths and pitfalls that await researchers investigating integration in plants and animals.},

	abstract = {Precise exponential scaling with size is a fundamental aspect of phenotypic variation. These allometric power laws are often invariant across taxa and have long been hypothesized to reflect developmental constraints. Here we test this hypothesis by investigating the evolutionary potential of an allometric scaling relationship in drosophilid wing shape that is nearly invariant across 111 species separated by at least 50 million years of evolution. In only 26 generations of artificial selection in a population of Drosophila melanogaster, we were able to drive the allometric slope to the outer range of those found among the 111 sampled species. This response was rapidly lost when selection was suspended. Only a small proportion of this reversal could be explained by breakup of linkage disequilibrium, and direct selection on wing shape is also unlikely to explain the reversal, because the more divergent wing shapes produced by selection on the allometric intercept did not revert. We hypothesize that the reversal was instead caused by internal selection arising from pleiotropic links to unknown traits. Our results also suggest that the observed selection response in the allometric slope was due to a component expressed late in larval development and that variation in earlier development did not respond to selection. Together, these results are consistent with a role for pleiotropic constraints in explaining the remarkable evolutionary stability of allometric scaling.},

Similarly, using different definitions of posterior tooth size (such as mandibular second molar length and maxillary postcanine area) alters results substantially. The same occurs with different definitions of anterior tooth size. It has been common in studies of primate dental allometry to generalize from the specific variables measured to broad functional interpretations. However, highly correlated variables cannot be substituted one for another in allometric analyses without important changes in the results of the equation.

However, interspecific analyses compiled during the first half of the 20th century concluded that mammalian basal MR (BMR, ml O2 h-1) was proportional to Mb3/4, a viewpoint that persisted for seven decades, even leading to its common application to non-mammalian groups. Beginning in 1997, the field was re-invigorated by three new theoretical explanations for 3/4-power BMR scaling. However, the debate over which theory accurately explains 3/4-power scaling may be premature, because some authors maintain that there is insufficient evidence to adopt an exponent of 3/4 over 2/3. If progress toward understanding the non-isometric scaling of BMR is ever to be made, it is first essential to know what the relationship actually is. We re-examine previous investigations of BMR scaling by standardising units and recalculating regression statistics. The proportion of large herbivores in a data set is positively correlated both with the scaling exponent (b, where BMR=aMbb) and the coefficient of variation (CV: the standard deviation of ln-ln residuals) of the relationship. Inclusion of large herbivores therefore both inflates b and increases variation around the calculated trendline. This is related to the long fast duration required to achieve the postabsorptive conditions required for determination of BMR, and because peak post-feeding resting MR (RMRpp) scales with an exponent of 0.75±0.03 (95\% CI). Large herbivores are therefore less likely to be postabsorptive when MR is measured, and are likely to have a relatively high MR if not postabsorptive.
The 3/4 power scaling of RMRpp is part of a wider trend where, with the notable exception of cold-induced maximum MR (b=0.65±0.05), b is positively correlated with the elevation of the relationship (higher MR values scale more steeply). Thus exercise-induced maximum MR (b=0.87±0.05) scales more steeply than RMRpp, field MR (b=0.73±0.04), thermoneutral resting MR (RMRt, b=0.712±0.013) and BMR. The implication of this observation is that contamination of BMR data with non-basal measurements is likely to increase the BMR scaling exponent even if the contamination is randomly distributed with respect to Mb. Artificially elevated scaling exponents can therefore be accounted for by the inclusion of measurements that fail to satisfy the requirements for basal metabolism, which are strictly defined (adult, non-reproductive, postabsorptive animals resting in a thermoneutral environment during the inactive circadian phase). Similarly, a positive correlation between Mb and body temperature (Tb) and between Tb and mass-independent BMR contributes to elevation of b. While not strictly a defined condition for the measurement of BMR, the normalisation of BMR measurements to a common Tb (36.2°C) to achieve standard metabolic rate (SMR) further reduces the CV of the relationship. Clearly the value of the exponent depends on the conditions under which the data are selected. The exponent for true BMR is 0.686 (±0.014), Tb normalised SMR is 0.675 (±0.013) and RMRt is 0.712 (±0.013).},

	abstract = {The relationship between ontogenetic, static, and evolutionary levels of allometry is investigated. Extrapolation from relative size relationships in adults to relative growth in ontogeny depends on the variability of slopes and intercepts of ontogenetic vectors relative to variability in length of the vector. If variability in slopes and intercepts is low relative to variability in length, ontogenetic and static allometries will be similar. The similarity of ontogenetic and static allometries was tested by comparing the first principal component, or size vector, for correlations among 48 cranial traits in a cross-sectional ontogenetic sample of rhesus macaques from Cayo Santiago with a static sample from which all age- and sex-related variation had been removed. The vector correlation between the components is high but significantly less than one while two of three allometric patterns apparent in the ontogenetic component are not discernable in the static component. This indicates that there are important differences in size and shape relationships among adults and within ontogenies. Extrapolation from intra- or interspecific phenotypic allometry to evolutionary allometry is shown to depend on the similarity of genetic and phenotypic allometry patterns. Similarity of patterns was tested by comparing the first principal components of the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlation matrices calculated using standard quantitative genetic methods. The patterns of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental allometry are dissimilar; only the environmental allometries show ontogenetic allometric patterns. This indicates that phenotypic allometry may not be an accurate guide to patterns of evolutionary change in size and shape.},

	abstract = {Allometry is a major determinant of within-population patterns of association among traits and, therefore, a major component of morphological integration studies. Even so, the influence of size variation over evolutionary change has been largely unappreciated. Here, we explore the interplay between allometric size variation, modularity, and life-history strategies in the skull from representatives of 35 mammalian families. We start by removing size variation from within-species data and analyzing its influence on integration magnitudes, modularity patterns, and responses to selection. We also carry out a simulation in which we artificially alter the influence of size variation in within-taxa matrices. Finally, we explore the relationship between size variation and different growth strategies. We demonstrate that a large portion of the evolution of modularity in the mammalian skull is associated to the evolution of growth strategies. Lineages with highly altricial neonates have adult variation patterns dominated by size variation, leading to high correlations among traits regardless of any underlying modular process and impacting directly their potential to respond to selection. Greater influence of size variation is associated to larger intermodule correlations, less individualized modules, and less flexible responses to natural selection.},

Geometric morphometric methods for the quantitative analysis of form variation were applied. Size and shape variables were computed and regressed onto geographical coordinates and environmental variables (elevation, temperature, rainfall, moisture and Shannon rainfall diversity index) using both linear and curvilinear models. Components (geographical, environmental, spatially structured environmental and residual) of ecogeographical variation in skull form were partitioned using partial regression. A novel approach for summarizing and visualizing nonlinear patterns of clinal variation using surface rendering of three-dimensional shapes is presented.Results Clinal variation in size and shape was highly significant, and was best described by curvilinear models. There were strong similarities between females and males. The cline in size was especially pronounced, explaining up to about 40\% of observed variation, and was mainly longitudinal rather than latitudinal. A major trend of clinal shape variation also occurred from west to east, and corresponded to an expansion of the face relative to the neurocranium in the west. In the east, skulls also tended to be deeper and with narrower zygomatic arches. Geography and the spatially structured environmental component were the major contributors to the explained variance in size in both sexes, but the proportion of variance explained by the latter was smaller in females. In contrast, geography and environment explained similar amounts of variation in shape and their contribution was about twice that of the spatially structured environmental component. About 60–80\% of variation in skull form was not explained by any variable in the analysis. The main factors influencing skull size differed in females and males, with rainfall being very influential in males. Both female and male skull shapes were strongly affected by average annual rainfall.Main conclusions A strong spatial and environmental basis to variations in African vervet monkey skull form was evident. However, the observed pattern did not conform to predictions based on Bergmann's rule. Rainfall consistently emerged as an important predictor, which may contribute to intraspecific variation in the size and shape of vervet monkey skulls through its effect on habitat productivity.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and patterns of biogeographic descent among primate species are both complex and contentious. Here, we generate a robust molecular phylogeny for 70 primate genera and 367 primate species based on a concatenation of 69 nuclear gene segments and ten mitochondrial gene sequences, most of which were extracted from GenBank. Relaxed clock analyses of divergence times with 14 fossil-calibrated nodes suggest that living Primates last shared a common ancestor 71–63 Ma, and that divergences within both Strepsirrhini and Haplorhini are entirely post-Cretaceous. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs played an important role in the diversification of placental mammals. Previous queries into primate historical biogeography have suggested Africa, Asia, Europe, or North America as the ancestral area of crown primates, but were based on methods that were coopted from phylogeny reconstruction. By contrast, we analyzed our molecular phylogeny with two methods that were developed explicitly for ancestral area reconstruction, and find support for the hypothesis that the most recent common ancestor of living Primates resided in Asia. Analyses of primate macroevolutionary dynamics provide support for a diversification rate increase in the late Miocene, possibly in response to elevated global mean temperatures, and are consistent with the fossil record. By contrast, diversification analyses failed to detect evidence for rate-shift changes near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary even though the fossil record provides clear evidence for a major turnover event (“Grande Coupure”) at this time. Our results highlight the power and limitations of inferring diversification dynamics from molecular phylogenies, as well as the sensitivity of diversification analyses to different species concepts.},

When species are compared within a clade, SSD is frequently found to vary with body size. This allometry is detected as β ≠ 1, where β is the slope of a model II regression of log (male size) on log(female size). Most frequently, β exceeds 1, indicating that SSD increases with size where males are the larger sex, but decreases with size where females are larger, a trend formalized as "Rensch's rule." Exceptions are uncommon and associated with female-biased SSD. These trends are derived from a sample of 40 independent clades of terrestrial animals, primarily vertebrates. Their extension to plants and aquatic animals awaits quantitative assessments of allometry for SSD within these groups. Many functional hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of allometry for SSD, most featuring sexual selection on males or reproductive selection on females. Of these, the hypothesis that allometry evolves because of correlational selection between the sexes appears most promising as a general model but remains untested.},

In the short term, the responses depend on genetic correlations between characters, but in the long term they are only determined by the fitness functions of stabilizing and directional selection, independent of genetic and phenotypic correlations. Treating the stabilizing component as a constant and assuming the directional component to vary among populations, I present formulas for the interpopulation covariation and interspecific allometry, which are functions of the intensity matrix of stabilizing selection.

Errors in estimaties of these nuisance variables will be reflected in the covariance structure of the coordinates, such as the residuals from a superimposition, or any linear combination of the coordinates, such as the partial warp and standard uniform scores. A simulation experiment was used to compare the ability of the generalized resistant fit (GRF) and a relative warp analysis (RWA) to estimate known covariance matrices with various correlations and variance structures. Random covariance matrices were perturbed so as to vary the magnitude of the average correlation among coordinates, the number of landmarks with excessive variance, and the magnitude of the excessive variance. The covariance structure was applied to random figures with between 6 and 20 landmarks. The results show the expected performance of GRF and RWA across a broad spectrum of conditions. The performance of both GRF and RWA depended most strongly on the number of landmarks. RWA performance decreased slightly when one or a few landmarks had excessive variance. GRF performance peaked when ∼25\% of the landmarks had excessive variance. In general, both RWA and GRF performed better at estimating the direction of the first principal axis of the covariance matrix than the structure of the entire covariance matrix. RWA tended to outperform GRF when {\textgreater} ∼ 75\% of the coordinates had excessive variance. When {\textless} ∼75\% of the coordinates had excessive variance, the relative performance of RWA and GRF depended on the magnitude of the excessive variance; when the landmarks with excessive variance had standard deviations (σ) ≥ 4σ minimum, GRF regularly outperformed RWA.},

	abstract = {The fundamentals of mechanics provide a strong basis for the hypothesis that allometry could be an important constraint on evolutionary changes in shape. Empirical evidence that allometry accounts for sufficient shape variation to be an effective constraint is much weaker. Numerous studies claim to show that most shape variation is correlated with size, but nearly all these studies use morphometric methods that confound size and shape. Consequently, the proportion of the shape variation correlated with size remains unknown. To address this issue, I examined ontogenetic change and adult variation in lower jaws of the fox squirrel, Sciurus niger. Jaw morphologies were quantified using traditional distance measurements and geometric shape variables computed from landmark coordinates. The same analyses were performed on each data set. As expected, analyses of the distance measurements found that allometry accounted for nearly all ontogenetic variation. The same analysis on the coordinate data found that allometry accounts for {\textless}50\% of the ontogenetic variation in shape. In analyses of adults, allometry explained {\textgreater}50\% of the variation in distance measurements but {\textless}25\% of the variation in shape. These results confirm that analyses of distance measurements confound size and shape and that this can lead to erroneous claims about the importance of allometry.},

	abstract = {Morphological traits often covary within and among species according to simple power laws referred to as allometry. Such allometric relationships may result from common growth regulation, and this has given rise to the hypothesis that allometric exponents may have low evolvability and constrain trait evolution. We formalize hypotheses for how allometry may constrain morphological trait evolution across taxa, and test these using more than three-hundred empirical estimates of static (within-species) allometric relations of animal morphological traits. Although we find evidence for evolutionary changes in allometric parameters on million-year, cross-species time scales, there is limited evidence for microevolutionary changes in allometric slopes. Accordingly, we find that static allometries often predict evolutionary allometries on the subspecies level, but less so across species. Although there is a large body of work on allometry in a broad sense that includes all kinds of morphological trait-size relationships, we found relatively little information about the evolution of allometry in the narrow sense of a power relationship. Despite the many claims of microevolutionary changes of static allometries in the literature, hardly any of these apply to narrow-sense allometry, and we argue that the hypothesis of strongly constrained static allometric slopes remains viable.This article is protected by copyright.

This pattern could result from natural selection for specific allometries or from developmental constraints on patterns of differential growth. We performed artificial selection on the allometry between forewing area and body size in a butterfly to test for developmental constraints, and then used the resultant increased range of phenotypic variation to quantify natural selection on the scaling relationship. Our results show that the short-term evolution of allometries is not limited by developmental constraints. Instead, scaling relationships are shaped by strong natural selection.},

	abstract = {Among all organisms, the size of each body part or organ scales with overall body size, a phenomenon called allometry. The study of shape and form has attracted enormous interest from biologists, but the genetic, developmental and physiological mechanisms that control allometry and the proportional growth of parts have remained elusive. Recent progress in our understanding of body-size regulation provides a new synthetic framework for thinking about the mechanisms and the evolution of allometric scaling. In particular, insulin/IGF signaling, which plays major roles in longevity, diabetes and the regulation of cell, organ and body size, might also be centrally involved in regulating organismal shape. Here we review recent advances in the fields of growth regulation and endocrinology and use them to construct a developmental model of static allometry expression in insects. This model serves as the foundation for a research program that will result in a deeper understanding of the relationship between growth and form, a question that has fascinated biologists for centuries.

	abstract = {To what extent within-species (static) allometries constitute a constraint on evolution is the subject of a long-standing debate in evolutionary biology. A prerequisite for the constraint hypothesis is that static allometries are hard to change. Several studies have attempted to test this hypothesis with artificial-selection experiments, but their results remain inconclusive due to various methodological issues. Here, we present results from an experiment in which we selected independently on the slope and the elevation of the allometric relationship between caudal-fin size and body size in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). After three episodes of selection, the allometric elevation (i.e. intercept at constant slope) had diverged markedly between the lines selected to increase or decrease it, and showed a realized heritability of 50\%. In contrast, the allometric slope remained unaffected by selection. These results suggest that the allometric elevation is more evolvable than the allometric slope, this latter representing a potential constraint on adaptive trait evolution. To our knowledge, this study is the first artificial-selection experiment that directly tests the evolvability of static allometric slopes.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
Artificial selection on body size in Manduca sexta produced genetic strains with large and small body sizes. The wing-body allometries of these strains differed significantly from the wild type. Selection on small body size led to a change in the scaling of wing and body size without changing the allometry: the wings were smaller relative to the body, but to the same degree at all body sizes. Selection for large body size led to a change in allometry with a decrease in the allometric coefficient, wing size becoming progressively smaller relative to body as body size increased. When larvae were deprived of food so as to produce adults of a range of small body sizes, all strains retained the same allometric coefficient but showed an increase in the scaling factor. Thus individuals starved as larvae had a smaller adult body size but had proportionally larger wings than fed individuals. We analyzed the developmental processes that could give rise to this pattern of allometries. Differences in the relative growth of body and wing disks can account for the differences in the allometric coefficients among the three body size strains. The change in wing-body allometry at large body sizes was primarily due to an insufficient time period for growth. The available time period for growth of the wing imaginal disks poses a significant constraint on the proportional growth of wings, and thus on the evolution of large body size.},

Allometry is the study of the consequences of differences in the growth of body parts on morphology, although the field of allometry has been surprisingly little concerned with understanding the causes of differential growth. The power-law equation y = axb, commonly used to describe allometries, is fundamentally an empirical equation whose biological foundation has been little studied. Huxley showed that the power-law equation can be derived if one assumes that body parts grow with exponential kinetics, for exactly the same amount of time. In life, however, the growth of body parts is almost always sigmoidal, and few, if any, grow for exactly the same amount of time during ontogeny. Here, we explore the shapes of allometries that result from real growth patterns and analyze them with new allometric equations derived from sigmoidal growth kinetics. We use an extensive ontogenetic dataset of the growth of internal organs in the rat from birth to adulthood, and show that they grow with Gompertz sigmoid kinetics. Gompertz growth parameters of body and internal organs accurately predict the shapes of their allometries, and that nonlinear regression on allometric data can accurately estimate the underlying kinetics of growth. We also use these data to discuss the developmental relationship between static and ontogenetic allometries. We show that small changes in growth kinetics can produce large and apparently qualitatively different allometries. Large evolutionary changes in allometry can be produced by small and simple changes in growth kinetics, and we show how understanding the development of traits can greatly simplify the interpretation of how they evolved.},

We show how scaling exponents reflect the relative fitness advantages of ornaments vs. somatic growth by using a simple mathematical model of resource allocation during ontogeny. Because the scaling exponents are similar for the different taxonomic groups, it follows that the fitness advantages of investing in ornaments also are similar. The model also shows how selection for ornaments influences body size at first reproduction and explains why interspecific allometries have consistently lower exponents than intraspecific ones.},

We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen. Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, OU models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models against data using maximum‐likelihood‐based model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary explanations.},

The choice of a size variable is a hitherto neglected, but important, part of an allometric study. The use of functional relationships in allometry is contrasted with the approach developed here.

	abstract = {The demand that anatomical structures work together to perform biological functions is thought to impose strong limits on morphological evolution. Breakthroughs in diversification can occur, however, when functional integration among structures is relaxed. Although such transitions are expected to generate variation in morphological diversification across the tree of life, empirical tests of this hypothesis are rare. Here we show that transitions between suction-based and biting modes of prey capture, which require different degrees of coordination among skull components, are associated with shifts in the pattern of skull diversification in eels (Anguilliformes). Biting eels have experienced greater independence of the jaws, hyoid and operculum during evolution and exhibit more varied morphologies than closely related suction feeders, and this pattern reflects the weakened functional integration among skull components required for biting. Our results suggest that behavioural transitions can change the evolutionary potential of the vertebrate skeleton by altering functional relationships among structures.

	abstract = {The purpose of this data set was to compile general life history characteristics for a variety of mammalian species in order to perform comparative life history analyses among different taxa and different body size groups. Data were collected from the literature, and data sources are documented for each species within the data file. Since life history characteristics will show minor variation with environmental conditions (resource availability, climate, competitive environment, and predation pressure) a general life history for each species was sought to average over minor differences in local populations. To create a general life history for each species, life history values are often an average from several literature sources. Life history variables included in the data set are: maximum lifespan (months), age of first reproduction (months), gestation time (months), weaning age (months), weaning mass (grams), litter size, litters per year, newborn mass (grams), and adult body mass (grams). Since these data were collected with the intent to examine general life history patterns, they are good for examining large-scale patterns, specifically in comparing life history characteristics for different orders or families of mammals. All orders of placental mammals, except Chiroptera (bats) are represented in this data set: Artiodactyla (161 species), Carnivora (197 species), Cetacea (55 species), Dermoptera (2 species), Hydracoidea (4 species), Insectivora (91 species), Lagomorpha (42 species), Macroscelidea (10 species), Perissodactyla (15 species), Pholidota (7 species), Primates (156 species), Proboscidea (2 species), Rodentia (665 species), Scandentia (7 species), Sirenia (5 species), Tubulidentata (1 species), and Xenarthra (20 species). There are two caveats on this data set, however. First, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of life history parameters with specific environmental conditions is important. Second, while this data set is extensive, it is not exhaustive. The creation of an exhaustive data set is the ultimate goal, but that goal is still several years from completion. In the meantime, researchers utilizing the data set are urged to conduct their own search for data not reported within the current data set. Researchers are also encouraged to contact the author of the data set and alert her to literature sources containing data for missing variables or species.},

	abstract = {Ontogeny is an important source of morphological changes. The combination of size and shape analyses throughout ontogeny helps us to better understand the importance of size and shape from an evolutionary and developmental point of view. Combining geometric and traditional morphometric analyses, we compared skull ontogenetic trajectories of 2 New World didelphimorphian marsupials, Didelphis and Philander. We obtained 32 landmarks and 35 Euclidean distances between these landmarks. Despite secondary sexual dimorphism in both genera, we obtained similar results for both sexes. Allometric comparisons showed similar skull growth patterns and rates. Most of the skull regions had negative allometric growth, except for the zygomatic region. The positive allometric growth of the zygomatic region is possibly related to the transition from lactation to solid food. We investigated size influence in separating genera, comparing analyses based on original and size-free data. Although original data separated both genera, size-free data failed to do so. We found a significant positive correlation between character changes (shape) and size when analyzing growing trajectories, suggesting an allometric change pattern. Geometric morphometrics also corroborated the notion of generic differences being mainly size-related (either scale or allometry). Vectors describing the ontogenetic trajectory were highly similar, both between genera and within each genus throughout ontogeny. Didelphis and Philander share the same orientation in their ontogenetic trajectories because of similar growth rates. However, Didelphis trajectories are relatively longer, indicating an extended growth period. Isometric size changes are responsible for 98.36\% of all differences between genera in adult specimens, whereas 1.43\% of differences is due to allometric shape variations, and 0.21\% is due exclusively to shape variation.},

Here, we derive a general quantitative model based on fundamental principles for the allocation of metabolic energy between maintenance of existing tissue and the production of new biomass. We thus predict the parameters governing growth curves from basic cellular properties and derive a single parameterless universal curve that describes the growth of many diverse species. The model provides the basis for deriving allometric relationships for growth rates and the timing of life history events.},

	abstract = {Although most studies on integration and modularity have focused on variation among individuals within populations or species, this is not the only level of variation for which integration and modularity exist. Multiple levels of biological variation originate from distinct sources: genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity resulting from environmental heterogeneity, fluctuating asymmetry from random developmental variation and, at the interpopulation or interspecific levels, evolutionary change. The processes that produce variation at all these levels can impart integration or modularity on the covariance structure among morphological traits. In turn, studies of the patterns of integration and modularity can inform about the underlying processes. In particular, the methods of geometric morphometrics offer many advantages for such studies because they can characterize the patterns of morphological variation in great detail and maintain the anatomical context of the structures under study. This paper reviews biological concepts and analytical methods for characterizing patterns of variation and for comparing across levels. Because research comparing patterns across level has only just begun, there are relatively few results, generalizations are difficult and many biological and statistical questions remain unanswered. Nevertheless, it is clear that research using this approach can take advantage of an abundance of new possibilities that are so far largely unexplored.},

	abstract = {Modularity is a central concept in modern biology, providing a powerful framework for the study of living organisms on many organizational levels. Two central and related questions can be posed in regard to modularity: How does modularity appear in the first place, and what forces are responsible for keeping and/or changing modular patterns? We approached these questions using a quantitative genetics simulation framework, building on previous results obtained with bivariate systems and extending them to multivariate systems. We developed an individual-based model capable of simulating many traits controlled by many loci with variable pleiotropic relations between them, expressed in populations subject to mutation, recombination, drift, and selection. We used this model to study the problem of the emergence of modularity, and hereby show that drift and stabilizing selection are inefficient at creating modular variational structures. We also demonstrate that directional selection can have marked effects on the modular structure between traits, actively promoting a restructuring of genetic variation in the selected population and potentially facilitating the response to selection. Furthermore, we give examples of complex covariation created by simple regimes of combined directional and stabilizing selection and show that stabilizing selection is important in the maintenance of established covariation patterns. Our results are in full agreement with previous results for two-trait systems and further extend them to include scenarios of greater complexity. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary consequences of modular patterns being molded by directional selection.},
